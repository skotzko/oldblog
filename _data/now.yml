  - text: "I just completed six months in residence at <a href='http://singularityu.org/gsp16/' target='_blank'>the Global Solutions Program at Singularity University (SU)</a>, located on NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, CA."
  - text: "While at SU, I helped start <a href='http://afriji.com' target='_blank'>Afriji</a>, a company building affordable, off-grid refrigeration solutions for the 1 billion+ people globally without a reliable source of electricity. While at SU, I especially loved collaborations with the Stanford d.school, Google X, and Lawrence Berkeley Labs."
