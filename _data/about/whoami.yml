title: What do I believe?
content:
  - text: "I believe that people are tired of being asked to do the minimum. That they're yearning to measure the full distance of their potential in service of what they care about."
  - text: "I believe that we have everything we need to create a world of abundance. I imagine a world where each person gets up in the morning and can go out and make their unique contribution to the world, rather than surviving it."
  - text: "So in everything I do, I aim to discover whatâ€™s possible so that people can express the full measure of their potential."
