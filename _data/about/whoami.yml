title: What do I believe?
content:
  - text: I believe that people are tired of being asked to do the minimum. I believe we're all yearning to measure the full distance of our potential in service of something important.
  - text: I imagine a world where each person gets up in the morning and can go out and make their unique contribution to the world, rather than surviving it. <a href='computing-the-battle-of-the-futures'>I believe we have what it takes to create this world of abundance.</a>
  - text: In everything I do, I work to realize what's possible so people realize what's possible for them.
