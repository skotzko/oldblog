title: What do I believe?
content:
  # - text: I believe that people are tired of being asked to do the minimum. I believe we're all yearning to measure the full distance of our potential in service of something important.
  - text: I imagine a world where each person gets up in the morning and can go out and make their unique contribution to the world, rather than surviving it. <a href='computing-the-battle-of-the-futures'>I believe we have what it takes to create this world of abundance.</a>
  - text: Everything I do is to enable people to thrive. I work to create the space where life thrives, where people and their environments aren't just surviving, but are fully alive.
