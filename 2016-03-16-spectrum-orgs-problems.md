# Orgs vs Problems

intro…what i've been exploring & people I've been talking to

asking big questions about what types of problems and what types of organizations are out there

here is what I'm seeing, thoughts in progress.

## role of each sector
(image of org spectrum & map against problems)

- business
- impact business / impact ventures
- social business
- nonprofit

certain types of these orgs are better suited to certain types of problems

## types of big problems
GGCs

## types of orgs
- business
- impact business / impact ventures
- social business
- nonprofit




***


impact ventures having capital opportunity that nonprofit doesn't
social business stock market could work, although it won't return dividends — but if owners retain their shares, isn't that equity that they could sell? unclear where the line is between nonprofit & social business

profound yearning to change the world

people are weary of being asked to do the least they can possibly do
people are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential on behalf of the causes they care about deeply

…but they have to be asked. (e.g. advertising)


for nonprofits, look at Dan Pallotta's work and understanding the ideological blocks to charity that we currently have in place



### does nonprofit even work?

business will move great mass of humanity forward
social business will take care of the rest
social business needs markets
some issues just won't have markets or don't have markets
there will always be some 10% of people most disadvantaged or for whose issue there is no market or should be no market.

charity & philanthropy exists to serve this, to serve the people for whom there is no market coming
nonprofit sector have to be part of the conversation if the world is to work for everyone
but the nonprofit sector doesn't seem to be working

poverty is 12% of USA population
massive problems vs tiny orgs against them, and beliefs that trap our nonprofits in being tiny





2% of GDP is charitable giving stuck there since started measuring in 1970s
investing in their growth => scalable fundraising
stop focusing on overhead: this is a demoralizing objective
ask about the scale of their dreams not their rate of overhead, and how they measure their progress toward those gaols
