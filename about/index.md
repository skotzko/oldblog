## Me in 10 seconds
* I'm a curious entrepreneur and believe we're either learning and growing, or dying
* I'm passionate about using technology to help people connect, express their humanity, and unlock their own capabilities
* I always keep asking questions, and try to share what I learn.
* My favorite parable: ["Eat Me If You Wish"](/eat-me-if-you-wish/)

I want to be as creative as possible and always keep learning and growing.
