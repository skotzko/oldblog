        <p>It’s an incredible moment when you meet the real person inside someone you’ve casually known for years.</p>

<p>Tonight I was at a dinner at USC with a large group of people I’ve known since my time there. Most of us have met before, had some meetings, maybe even been out socially in that sort-of-colleagues-but-also-sort-of-friends way that was so common in my life before I got that I have to bring who I really am to everything I do.</p>

<p>At dinner, I re-connected with a college peer I’ve known for about six years. I wouldn’t say we were ever friends, but we knew each other and had worked together. After dinner, we walked together across campus and had the first real conversation we’ve ever had. It was exciting—I made a new friend, a real friend—we had independently experienced similar struggles and were discussing our journeys since leaving college. When we parted, I felt like I had just met an entirely different person. We hugged, and without even thinking I said “nice to meet you” to a guy I’ve known for six years. But in a sense, I had just met the real him for the first time.</p>

<p>Conversations are powerful.</p>

<p>Conversations are powerful because moments are powerful. Moments are where we take risk.

        <p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/04/push_hands1.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p>Josh Waitzkin was about to get his ass kicked, and he knew it.</p> <p>In November 2000, Josh Waitzkin, a former national chess master—he was the subject of the movie “Searching for Bobby Fischer”—was competing in the opening round of the Chung Hwa Cup, the world championship of the Tai Chi Push Hands martial art. His opening match was supposed to be just after 9am. Around 8:30, Waitzkin went into his thirty minute pre-match routine. However, the matches did not proceed according to the official posted schedule (the Taiwanese officials of this tournament often devise tricks to throw off foreign competitors). Waitzkin had no food to snack on, and by noon he was starving and ate the greasy food he was given. Minutes after finishing his meal, he was called to the judges table and told that his match would begin immediately. He had no time to warm up or prepare. He was scattered, unfocused, and had a stomach full of greasy food. The match was over before it even began.</p> <p>Waitzkin was obliterated in minutes. Waitzkin left that tournament shell-shocked, and infuriated that he didn’t even give himself a real shot at competing due to his lack of flexibility as a performer. He also left determined to return again, ready for anything.</p> <p>Underneath his astounding achievements, Josh Waitzkin is one of the best learners in the world. By this I mean that he has become world-class at becoming world-class. Often referred to as meta-learning, it is mastery of the learning process itself. I recently read Waitzkin’s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Learning-Journey-Performance/dp/0743277465">The Art of Learning</a>, and was shocked by the depth of his understanding of the learning process and its relationship to achieving and sustaining elite performance. If you’re interested in exploring that connection, I highly recommend reading...

    <div class='content'>
      
        <p>Have you met The Zealot lately?</p>

<p>He’s the bombastic preacher who blasts all other forms of worship.</p>

<p>He’s the chess player who is entirely reliant on memorized gambits to win or confound his opponent, and is upset when it’s not enough.</p>

<p>He’s the middle manager who insists that This is How It Must Be Done. Why? Because this is how it must be done.</p>

<p>What do these zealots share? Circular logic. A vague malaise. A low sense of their ability to create or adapt to new ways of doing things. An inability to improvise, because they have not grasped the deeper principles of their chosen framework and integrated those principles into an overall seamless flow in decision making.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/03/charlie.jpg" alt="" />
&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;On the other hand, there’s Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger">Charlie Munger</a> is a billionaire and philanthropist who is the cofounder of Berkshire Hathaway. Charlie is famous for giving speeches, and being able to think very deeply about a wide range of problems.</p>

<p>Here’s the difference between Charlie and The Zealot: <strong>dependence</strong>.</p>

<p>Charlie knows that every framework has a point of view that can be useful.
