If there’s ever a time of year when we want to feel human connection, it’s around Valentine’s Day. And connection requires vulnerability and honesty, experiencing the world through another’s eyes.</p>

<p>Here are two questions that I’ve found helpful in authentically opening up my work and thinking to others over the last few months, which has led to some wonderful connections and conversations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What do the things that I feel compelled to do tell me about myself?</li>
  <li>Why do I want this thing that I want?</li>
</ol>

<p>Both are variants on the same theme: understanding what is driving you from within. Being honest with yourself, and in turn, others. At having a chance of doing this thing you want to do authentically and humanly.</p>

<p>And the experience of authentic human connection, of a shared human experience that means something?</p>

<p>In a digital world, it turns out that is what our analog hearts are really after.</p>

        <p>After a long day in transit, I wanted to share a note of lessons I wrote in hopes that my future niece learns them earlier than I did:</p> <ol> <li>The world is both big and small and travel is one of the best things you can do for yourself. Embrace it. Get out into it.</li> <li>Learn to pack light. You need much less than you think.</li> <li>Keep asking “why?” and consider it as a major warning sign if someone in authority doesn’t want to answer, gets frustrated when you ask, or can’t answer the question without a tautology.</li> <li>“Because that’s just how it’s done” is the worst answer to this question.</li> <li>Learn to listen for and recognize the quiet voice inside of you that you know is your soul.</li> <li>Do whatever you have to in order to protect and cherish this voice. Some people will try to crush it.</li> <li>Avoid those people. They aren’t worth your time and are toxic for you.</li> <li>Basic personal finance and statistics will save your ass.</li> <li>Avoid debt like the plague. It is one of the oldest forms of slavery in the world, but is made to appear as “normal.”</li> <li>On that note, don’t watch TV, or whatever its equivalent is by the time you’re old enough to. It will try to lie to you about almost everything that is important and make you feel bad about yourself so you buy crap you don’t need or believe in ideas that don’t serve you.</li> <li>Curiosity and “dangerous questions” are what we need more of. All progress depends on these.</li> <li>Ignorance is not the same as stupidity. If you don’t know something, find out. Ask, learn, repeat.</li> <li>Avoid anyone who tries to make you feel bad for being curious, learning something, or trying to improve yourself and...

        <p>Nobody likes to start something with a failure.</p> <p>Especially a public something.</p> <p>I just did that.</p> <h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2> <p>A few months ago, I announced that I was going to begin publishing my ongoing experiments. In <a href="http://www.andrewskotzko.com/2013/06/25/announcing-personal-experiments/">experiment 1</a>, I hoped to make some physical changes and feel better, have more energy, etc. The plan was to workout and quantify my progress both inside and outside my body.</p> <p>It was a good idea, a good intention, and decently planned out. But it was too much, too soon.</p> <p>I was trying to do everything all at once. I was working out intensely, at least 4 days a week. I was tracking everything I ate down to the calorie and macronutrient profile. I was tracking my steps, commute times, blood markers, mood, hours of sleep, and basically everything else I could think of. My OCD-tendencies blossomed into fullness on this one, to my partial regret. I don’t regret the things I started to track, or the intentions I came up with: I was truly seeking useful data. But I do regret the way I did it: all at once. The other mistake I made was to make it a BIG thing (to my mind) that was fairly long term (4 months).</p> <p>I’m declaring Experiment 1 a failure because I was not able to finish the experiment and fell off the wagon.</p> <h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2> <p>Here is a link to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApBq5nqLSn9MdDBIdFdrZGZzQUY0UzFBUVh5emtSOWc&amp;usp=sharing">spreadsheet where I was tracking everything</a>.</p> <p>Looking over those documents, a few things are clear: I was more consistent at doing the workouts than I was at tracking it all. In fact, I found the tracking aspect exhausting due to how manual everything was. I kept doing the workouts and diet for over a month but quit all the tracking...
