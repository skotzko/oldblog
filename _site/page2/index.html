        <p>Over the last several months, I’d fallen off the wagon writing-wise due to very heavy client workloads. I’m finally getting back into it after wrapping up a project. Given the restart, I got to wondering about my writing workflow and which tools I use.</p> <p>In whatever I do (coding, writing, etc) I’m always concerned with tools and establishing a good workflow and rhythm. For me, that means mobility and cross-platform access to what I’m working on. I want my data stored in the cloud so it isn’t tied to any one physical device or location, and so it’s properly backed up off-premises. This protects my work from accidents (or stupidity) well, and gives me flexibility about when, where and how I do my work. I appreciate that.</p> <p>After a quick chat with <a href="http://twitter.com/scotthurff">Scott</a> (he’s currently finishing a <a href="http://scotthurff.com/perfecting-product-design/">book on product design</a>), I decided to use <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> as the main organizational hub for everything, with all my files stored in <a href="https://db.tt/CNoIMVg">Dropbox</a>. In case you’re unfamiliar with Scrivener, it’s a professional-grade writing suite used by many journalists, authors, researchers, et al. Basically, if you’re doing serious writing, Scrivener is a one-stop shop and damn useful. It is also complex.</p> <p>I’m a huge fan of Scrivener for overall project organization and editing. But I don’t love it for actual writing. The layout is too distracting and its composition mode doesn’t feel focused enough for me. So I pair Scrivener with <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac/">iA Writer</a>, which is my favorite text editor to actually write in. I do this by using <a href="http://iainbroome.com/scrivener-mobile-sync">Scrivener’s external sync via Dropbox</a>, and voila! I have a beautiful cross-platform environment to write in. I also like the idea that my writing is safely stored in Dropbox, and I’m able to work on it anywhere, anytime, from any...

Skim read time: 5 minutes. Full read time: 32 minutes.</em></p> <p>From November until March I worked remotely and traveled in South America. Working remotely and exploring the world is something I’ve wanted to do ever since I first learned the term “location independent” as a college sophomore. But until this trip, I’d never done it. So with no lead time, in early November I booked a one-way ticket to Buenos Aires.</p> <p>Just one problem: I didn’t speak Spanish. I took Spanish in high school, but I couldn’t remember anything useful. And I’m not sure I could apply it in conversation even if I could remember it.</p> <p>Onboard the redeye flight from Miami to Buenos Aires, my lack of Spanish was immediately clear. I sat next to an Argentine man who turned to me and started speaking. Even though he spoke simply, I could not understand him. It had already been an eighteen hour day, and my best intentions failed within ten seconds. Flush with embarrassment, I admitted defeat: “no hablo español.”</p> <p>Fast-forward six weeks to arrive at one of the proudest moments of the trip: I sitting in a dark little cerveceria named Konna in Bariloche, in Northern Patagonia, drinking beer surrounded by native Spanish speakers. And having real conversations in Spanish. Conversations that went beyond what foods I had eaten, what I thought of the town, and where I was traveling from and to. A real conversation amongst friends in a...

<blockquote>
  <p>In life, I regret the things I didn’t do more than the missteps I made along the way.<br />- David Stanley</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the last three months, I traveled throughout South America. Despite what my <a href="http://instagram.com/skotzko">Instagram photos</a> may suggest, for the first month I was on the road, I was not enjoying it. Everything was new and stressful. There were no familiar places or friends to fall back on. The lack of regular schedules shot my all routines to hell. I felt lonely without my friends, and had no idea what I was doing. I drank too much, and exercised too little.</p>

<h2 id="searching-far-from-home">Searching, far from home</h2>
<p>I had gone away to get out of the tech scene for a while, for a change of pace and scenery. I had recently left <a href="http://chill.com">Chill</a>, where I’d driven myself at a maniacal pace for almost three years. I needed time and space to think, refresh, and get some perspective.</p>

<p>But I was 6,121 miles away, and it wasn’t working.</p>

<p>On the night of December 21st, I remember calling <a href="http://mattdsandler.com/">Matt</a> from my apartment in Buenos Aires. I’d talked myself in circles, about whether this crazy trip was still a good idea.</p>

<p>Should I just go back to California and take another job? Should I scrap the idea of trying to build something of my own? I was minutes away from booking a trip back to the USA so I could spend the holidays with friends and family.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Matt helped me see that I was just looking for familiarity. But why wasn’t I enjoying myself in Buenos Aires, a city full of steak, beautiful women, and dreams?
