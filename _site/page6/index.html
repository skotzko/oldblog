<p>On Friday, November 10th, 2006, Lawrence Jackson was running out of time. The All-American defensive end for the USC Trojans had yet to register a sack in his junior season. Coming into the season, Jackson had his sights on a national title, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bednarik_Award">Bednarik award</a>, and possibly a first-round pick in the coming NFL draft.</p>

<p>But so far? Eight games in. Zero sacks.</p>

<p>Jackson obsessed over it. It was all he thought about. As Jackson saw it at the time, even if he was playing well overall, without sacks, he was invisible.</p>

<p>But by midnight on Saturday the 11th, Jackson was the star of USC’s victory over Oregon—a nationally televised, primetime game with major implications on bowl bids. He accumulated three sacks, ten tackles, and one tackle for a loss—a landmark game by any standard.</p>

<p>So what changed in a mere 36 hours?</p>

<p>His approach to the game.

        <p><img class="center" src="/images/2013/02/floor.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p>Two months ago, I was scared. Scared I wouldn’t be able to keep up the course I was on. Scared my progress would grind to a stop. Scared I wouldn’t be able to deliver on the commitments that I’d made. Scared that I couldn’t cut it on the new level I was playing at.</p> <p>See, about five months before that, I’d decided to go full time into product and software engineering with very little background in it. It was an incredible opportunity: join one of the best software product teams in the world and learn from, and with, the best. My answer was yes, almost without thinking, when I got the chance.</p> <p>That was the end of last April. True or not, I believed that to rapidly get to a level where I could really contribute, I’d have to make an almost Faustian bargain: I would have to drop everything else in my life to learn what I needed to in such a short period of time. Social life, hobbies, most everything that I did for fun, gone. Note: there was no explicit deadline looming, but I always feel the clock ticking in my head. One of the curses of my brain. But to me, this deal was a no-brainer.</p> <p>Pulling it off damn near broke me. As of early December, I was burned out. Totally fried. I could barely think straight anymore — even easy problems felt overwhelming, and I felt a sort of persistent mental cloudiness. I’d experienced that once or twice before in my life, but not in years. I knew something was seriously wrong and needed to change, stat, or things were going downhill.</p> <p>It turned out the answer was two-fold: first, I needed to take care of myself physically. It’s...

        <p>Because they’re always asking the wrong question: “How?”</p>

<p>“How can we get there first?”</p>

<p>“How can I have more sex?”</p>

<p>“How can we beat Google?”</p>

<p>“How can I get his attention?”</p>

<p>“How can we get more press?”</p>

<p>“How can we increase our profits?”</p>

<p>“How can I lose 20 pounds?”</p>

<p>“How can we do this cheaper?”</p>

<p>“How can we get more users?”</p>

<p><strong>“How” is the wrong question when trying to generate ideas.</strong></p>

<p>It’s the wrong question because “How?” asks for a single answer, the best answer.</p>

<p>Framing the question this way for your brain short-circuits <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U&amp;t=7m43s">divergent thinking, which is what we need more of</a>.</p>

<p>Far more effective to ask, “In what ways could we <strong>__<em>?” or “What are some ways we could __</em></strong>?”</p>

<p>It’s a subtle change and WILL feel cheesy the first time you try it.</p>

<p>But this subtle change makes all the difference in the quantity of ideas you generate. And quantity of ideas leads to quality of ideas. So get brainstorming and make something interesting.</p>
