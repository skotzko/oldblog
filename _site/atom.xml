        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/gun.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>One of my earliest memories is of a decrepit, dusty blue Toyota pickup truck lazily rolling past our house. It was June 1991, and my family lived in N’Djamena, Chad. I was five.</p>

<p>The bed of this truck was spilling over with African men carrying rifles. In the middle of the truck bed, there was some sort of tower-like thing sticking up. Something tall and alien looking poking its head out above the gaggle of men in the back of the truck.</p>

<p>It was an anti-aircraft gun.</p>

<p>At first, I didn’t understand. I mean, I had seen a gun like that before when I went on a tour of a retired battleship from World War II. But what was this huge gun doing in the back of a truck? And what was it about how it looked that seemed so… wrong?</p>

<p>Then it hit me: The anti-aircraft gun wasn’t pointed at the sky.</p>

<p>The gun was mounted for use at street level.</p>

<p><a name="morelink"></a>
That anti-aircraft gun, and that truck full of men, were on their way to kill people.</p>

<p>I have never forgotten that.
<!-- more --></p>

<p>I spent years of my youth in Africa and Asia, and was evacuated from countries a few times due to civil unrest and armed conflict. From early on, I saw that the world could be a very harsh place.</p>

<p>But I also saw grace, compassion, generosity, tender moments of intimacy. So far, I’ve been to 53 countries and all 7 continents (yes, even Antarctica). Even when they had nothing in the way of material possessions, I’ve seen how people from all walks of life could joyfully connect with each other and compassionately share the experience of being alive here on our pale blue dot.</p>

<p>But you know the most important thing I saw in these travels?</p>

<p><strong>I saw a world bursting at the seams with human potential</strong>.</p>

<p>I still see that world. Let me tell you about it.</p>

<h2 id="a-crisis">A crisis</h2>
<p>When you talk to many people about the trajectory of the world, their outlook falls somewhere between a vague malaise and feeling resigned to a desolate, post-apocalyptic future. This sad future seems inevitable to them, beyond their control.</p>

<p>They can’t really explain it, and if you prod them on why they believe this is, you’ll get some sort of quasi-rational explanation. See if you’ve ever heard any of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“The planet is going to run out of food. The population is growing too fast!”</li>
  <li>“We’re just gonna end up nuking each other into oblivion.”</li>
  <li>“What can I do about poverty and war in Africa? I’m just one person!”</li>
  <li>“Our company moves too slow! We’re gonna get killed by some new startup that innovates faster…”</li>
</ul>

<p>…and so it goes. But here’s the thing: <em>these explanations are bullshit</em>.</p>

<p>Though each of these sounds rational and plausible—hey, we’ve all said something like this—each of these reasons is nothing more than a symptom of the crisis we are ACTUALLY facing.</p>

<p><em>We are facing a crisis of imagination</em>.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<h2 id="the-battle-of-the-futures">The battle of the futures</h2>
<p>Most people are living into a default future that they don’t even realize exists. Dave Logan and Steve Zaffron discussed this at length in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-Laws-Performance-Rewriting-Organization/dp/111804312X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428346123&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=dave+logan">this book</a>, but the gist is this:</p>

<p>All people and organizations have a “default future,” that is, the future they already have. Yours is the one you know is going to be happen, that is written, that’s in your gut. It’s made up of your hopes, dreams, and aspirations. It is the answer to the question, “what is likely to happen, if nothing unexpected comes along?”</p>

<p>This future drives your actions in a way that requires no thought on your part. It is essentially pre-ordained for you, and you’re just living into it from moment to moment. This is is why it feels inevitable, even though you may want to change it.</p>

<p>The answer to the question, “how do I change this future?” is as simple as it is powerful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z3r9dw_Jso">You rewrite it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="an-opportunity">An opportunity</h2>
<p>Of all the things I’ve seen in my travels, the most important is a world bursting with potential, begging to be unleashed.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where people everywhere can collaborate and pool their ideas and effort to invent things that none of them could create alone.</p>

<p>Imagine a world of universal access to personalized education.</p>

<p>Imagine the staggering capabilities of <a href="http://peterdiamandis.tumblr.com/post/115575716698/rising-billions-dramatic-positive-change">the rising billion</a> plugging into the global network and creating massive new markets and opportunities. (“The fastest way to become a billionaire? Help a billion people.”)</p>

<p><em>Imagine if the human race could benefit from the very best in all of us.</em> Imagine if we could access and benefit from the full potential of every. single. person. What could be possible then?</p>

<p><strong>This is the world I envision: a world where everyone has the chance to realize their potential</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-it-take">What will it take?</h2>
<p>In a word: abundance.</p>

<p>Abundance is how we make a world where each and every human being has the opportunity to contribute their unique gift to the planet and our race, rather than just trying to survive.</p>

<p>I believe a world of abundance is within our reach in my lifetime.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-abundance">What is abundance?</h3>
<p>When I say “a world of abundance,” this is what I mean:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abundance is <em>not</em> about providing everyone on this planet with a life of luxury—rather it’s about providing all with a life of possibility… Ultimately, abundance is about creating a world of possibility: a world where everyone’s days are spent dreaming and doing, not scrapping and scraping.</p>

  <p>- <a href="https://twitter.com/peterdiamandis">Peter Diamandis</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="how-do-we-create-a-world-of-abundance">How do we create a world of abundance?</h3>
<p>For me, it starts with technology. Technology is a resource liberator, an enabler of and force multiplier for possibility and potential.</p>

<p>To create an abundant world, we’re going to have to solve problems that we have no idea how to solve right now.</p>

<p>To create an abundant world, we’re going to need breakthroughs in every critical field, such as clean energy production, farming, clean water, healthcare, and education, just to name a few.</p>

<p>What do these diverse fields all have in common? <strong>Computers</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="my-mission">My mission</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca">Marc Andreessen</a> famously said, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">“software is eating the world.”</a></p>

<p>Software is now a critical component in every major industry and field. Computing is a driving force that helps every other field advance itself, whether by running massive simulations to discover the best way to design a new machine, creating a smart energy grid, creating affordable and personalized healthcare and education, and so on.</p>

<p>What could happen to advance food production, clean energy, water management, healthcare and education, as the power of infinite computing is coupled with the collective ingenuity and wisdom of crowds?</p>

<p>Creativity, aided by infinite computing, is how we’re going to solve the problems standing between us and the abundant future we need.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is “infinite computing”?</strong></p>

  <p>Infinite computing is the confluence of three trends: an exponential increase in available computing power; access to that power; and the precipitous fall in the cost of that power. Today, computing is the least expensive resource we can throw at a problem. And when one combines these trends with the scalability that we can now access via the cloud, we can deploy hundreds, even thousands, of computers to help solve the growing number of challenges we face as designers, engineers and artists.</p>

  <p>- <a href="https://twitter.com/carlbass">Carl Bass</a>, in <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/03/ideas-bank/weve-reached-infinity">Wired Magazine</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-software-of-our-future">The software of our future</h4>
<p>Here’s the kicker: <em>the software of our future will not be written like the software of our past.</em></p>

<p>The software of our future will be distributed, existing across a massive network of computers. It will be infinitely scalable on demand. It will react to data as needed and take the right actions, at the right time, in the right place.</p>

<p>This infinite computing resource will be used by every scientist, every artist, every engineer, every tinkerer and person who wants to apply their ingenuity and effort and create. When paired with their passion, the possibilities for what can be created are unlimited.</p>

<p>And that’s why <strong>I’m committed to making the power of distributed computing accessible to everyone, so more people are able to use this critical resource to invent our future</strong>.</p>

<p>I may not know much about solving problems in nanotechnology, clean water, energy production or other essential fields, but I can collaborate with domain experts who do and create computing resources for them to figure it out. (Coincidentally, this is why I started <a href="http://petabridge.com">Petabridge</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/aaronontheweb">Aaron</a>: to help software developers discover entirely new ways to take on audacious challenges.)</p>

<h3 id="what-can-you-do-today">What can you do today?</h3>
<p>First: If you’re reading this on a modern laptop or smartphone in a first-world country, realize how lucky you already are. Compared to the rest of the world, regardless of how much money you make, you are in the 1%.</p>

<p>Second: <em>Realize that you can rewrite your future, and in turn, our future.</em></p>

<p>Third: <strong>Here are five ways you can help</strong> create a world of abundance starting now. Pick one and run with it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>No matter what you currently do, I implore you to <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en">discover what matters to you</a></li>
  <li>Learn more about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Abundance-Future-Better-Than-Think/dp/145161683X/">what it will take to create a world of abundance</a></li>
  <li>Learn about some of <a href="http://www.abundancethebook.com/what-if/">the critical challenges on the way to abundance</a>, and start working on one that inspires you</li>
  <li>Be a digital volunteer and help people all around the world <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/contribute">learn anything with the Khan Academy</a></li>
  <li>If you’re a programmer, get involved with an open-source distributed computing project like <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> on the JVM, <a href="http://getakka.net">Akka.NET</a> on the CLR, <a href="https://celluloid.io/">Celluloid</a> in Ruby, or <a href="https://www.pykka.org/en/latest/">Pykka</a> in Python</li>
</ol>

<p>This is just the beginning of a conversation that is going to bring about an exciting future for us.</p>

<p>What about an abundant world excites you? Leave a comment below and let’s continue the conversation. Ultimately, I’m an impatient optimist and would love to rewrite the future with you, whoever and wherever you are.</p>

        <updated>2015-01-14T11:11:22-08:00</updated>
        <id>https://andrewskotzko.com/introducing-petabridge</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/interactive_data.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The future of computing is a massively-connected world where everyone and their mother has 3+ devices. That means data. Lots and lots of data.</p>

<p><a href="http://andrewskotzko.com/follow-your-curiosity/">Early last year, I started deeply exploring distributed systems and large-scale data processing</a>. Since then, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking and discussing these forces and what to do about them with my longtime friend and fellow developer, <a href="http://www.aaronstannard.com/">Aaron Stannard</a>. We became very interested in how these ideas could be applied in the global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET ecosystem</a>, which is the technical ecosystem that supports many of the world’s largest companies (major banks, the Fortune 500, etc).</p>

<p>There’s massive amounts of value locked up inside the minds of developers all over this ecosystem, and they haven’t had the tools to realize those ideas. Due to the <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/2014/11/12/microsoft-takes-net-open-source-and-cross-platform-adds-new-development-capabilities-with-visual-studio-2015-net-2015-and-visual-studio-online/">previously proprietary nature of the .NET ecosystem</a>, most solutions and knowledge have been siloed behind corporate firewalls, never shared with the larger community. The open-sourced tools, training and knowledge just aren’t there in this ecosystem, despite its financial wealth.</p>

<p>So what is a creative developer in .NET-land to do, if she wants to learn how to build the distributed processing systems and scalable apps that are our technical future?</p>

<p>There haven’t been very many good answers to that question. Until now.</p>

<p>Over the last several months, Aaron and I have seen commercial interest in <a href="https://akkadotnet.github.io/">Akka.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/helios">Helios</a> pick up dramatically. (Both of these projects are fundamental tools for doing high-performance distributed data processing in the .NET framework.)</p>

<p>And so…</p>

<h2 id="introducing-petabridge">Introducing Petabridge</h2>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/petabridge">
<img class="right" src="/images/petabridge_logo.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I am pleased to announce that I am co-founding <a href="http://twitter.com/petabridge/">Petabridge</a> – a company dedicated to making distributed computing easy and accessible for .NET developers. My partner in crime is my friend and fellow fanatic, Aaron. (And yes, it’s sometimes confusing that we have the same initials.)</p>

<p><em>Why am I doing this? I’ve always been obsessed with unlocking potential and empowering people in scalable ways, and I can think of no better way to do that than to help tens of thousands of developers around the world create more great stuff</em>.</p>

<p>Writing great open-source software is hard. Really hard. It starts with individuals and is fundamentally community-driven. But open-source ecosystems also need corporate stewards to make them sustainable over the long-term. These stewards continually drive the platform forward when individual developers are focused on their own lives. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra">Cassandra</a> has <a href="http://datastax.com/">DataStax</a>, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/">Java</a> has <a href="http://www.oracle.com/index.html">Oracle</a>, <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> has <a href="http://typesafe.com/">TypeSafe</a>, and so on.</p>

<p>The beating heart of <a href="http://twitter.com/petabridge/">Petabridge</a> is open source software (OSS) and community contribution. We’re making it our goal to build a business around .NET open source projects like <a href="https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/helios">Helios</a> and <a href="https://akkadotnet.github.io/">Akka.NET</a>, initially by offering training, support, and consulting services for companies who want to use them.</p>

<p>All along the way, we will be continually contributing work, tools, and knowledge back to the community under the appropriate OSS licenses to help more developers unlock their potential, and that of their ideas.</p>

<p>We believe that <a href="https://akkadotnet.github.io/">Akka.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/helios">Helios</a> have a larger role to play in the .NET ecosystem and will act as the foundation for more ambitious, distributed programming projects that haven’t even been invented yet. We’re noodling on several such designs ourselves. Both of these tools are foundational in doing distributed, realtime decision-making on large streams of data. For example, imagine having 50 tickets to a private Neil Diamond show to sell to 10,000 raving fans who are bidding at the same time—which bids win? How do you dynamically price it so that the tickets go to the highest bidders, and also not oversell tickets? <a name="morelink"></a>Making the right decisions, in realtime, across many distributed parties is a difficult software problem, with major financial implications for the business.<!-- more --></p>

<p>I see a bright future ahead for .NET and its OSS ecosystem, but it needs companies like <a href="http://twitter.com/petabridge/">Petabridge</a> to support the bigger projects and develop data platforms for the ecosystem. Writing open source code is one key element, but educating developers to use it is another – especially with something as mind-twisting as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">the Actor model</a> used by <a href="https://akkadotnet.github.io/">Akka.NET</a>.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-we-start">Where do we start?</h2>
<p><img class="left" src="/images/akka_net_logo_only.png" alt="" /> So while we continue to contribute to the open-source development in this space, the first order of business is education. There are tens of thousands of developers around the globe who need to learn this material to unlock the value that’s tied up in their heads.</p>

<p>The first thing <a href="http://twitter.com/petabridge/">Petabridge</a> will be offering is soup-to-nuts Akka.NET training – learn everything from how the Actor model works to how to deploy substantial Akka.NET applications in production. We’ll take you from 20 to 120 and get you ready to build and run scalable, distributed applications in .NET. We’re already building tools and products that will be released down the line, starting with several tools to make the development/testing process easier for distributed software.</p>

<p>We’ll be offering free tutorials and webinars online covering everything from distributed computing fundamentals to Akka.NET—so <a href="http://petabridge.com">go to our website and sign up to receive updates about upcoming Akka.NET training and the latest tips and tricks that we share.</a></p>

<p>And while I’m busy bossing you around, dear reader, I might as well go ahead and ask you to <a href="http://twitter.com/petabridge">go follow us on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Onward!</p>

        <updated>2014-09-13T20:25:28-07:00</updated>
        <id>https://andrewskotzko.com/follow-your-curiosity</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/desert_walk.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>NB: This is the first post in an ongoing, “good advice” series, where I pay forward the advice I’ve received which has made or is making a real difference for me.</em></p>

<p>I’ve been feeling damn frustrated since I got back from South America. Since I returned, I’ve been exploring different technological landscapes, looking to see which area draws me in.</p>

<p><a name="morelink"></a>
From May through July, I spent a lot of my time building crappy prototypes. And trying to come up with new ideas. And I didn’t like any of them.
<!-- more --></p>

<h2 id="organic-interest">Organic interest</h2>
<p>Either the ideas were just plain bad, or weren’t sustainably interesting to me. There were quite a few that would work and make somebody a lot of money, but not me—I was just the wrong person to deliver on that idea. I mean, if I couldn’t get myself interested in working on something for more than two weeks, how could I possibly build it into something real and interesting for other people? Nonstarter.</p>

<p>There has to be a basis of organic interest.</p>

<h2 id="the-wrong-question">The (Wrong) Question?</h2>
<p>By July, I felt very frustrated by the lack of progress and the desire to have a direction to run in. So I started asking other entrepreneurs, “what do you do in this situation? what do you do when you’re trying to come up with something interesting and hating everything you’re coming up with?”</p>

<p>This was a mental walk through the desert. This became The Question.</p>

<p><strong>The Question generated a lot of answers. Mostly useless answers.</strong></p>

<p>Why? Because The Question was actually The Wrong Question.</p>

<p>In July, I was up in San Francisco and had lunch with <a href="https://twitter.com/matjohnson">Mat Johnson</a>, a very smart guy who works on distribution with <a href="http://500.co">500 Startups</a> portfolio companies. Just like everyone else, Mat got hit with The (soon to be known as) Wrong Question. His response? “Yeah, that’s not going to work. You’re forcing it.”</p>

<p>Okay. So, what would? His advice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wish I could give you a formula for this, but as far as I know there isn’t one.</p>

  <p>The only approach I think has a decent chance of working is just to follow your curiosity and see where it leads you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As soon as I heard that, I knew it was true. Nonetheless, what <em>I</em> should do didn’t occur to me for awhile.</p>

<p>I took stock of all the different areas I’d looked at in the last six months. All the prototypes, white papers, use cases, everything. What I quickly realized was that all the things that I’d actually thought were interesting, that I thought were neat or cool—as opposed to what I thought I should be interested in—what did these things have something in common?</p>

<p>And that something was the fact that <strong>they all involved turning gobs of data into useful information.</strong> (Information != data.)</p>

<p>These were use cases such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automatically detecting and preventing e-commerce fraud by using machine learning</li>
  <li>making weather satellites adapt their scanning based on realtime feeds from ground sensors</li>
  <li>predicting which uber-expensive piece of manufacturing equipment most likely to fail next</li>
</ul>

<p>These are somewhat prosaic on the surface, but actually fascinating in terms of how these results are accomplished. I’m hooked—this big data stuff is thrilling.</p>

<h2 id="new-ground">New ground</h2>
<p>The ridiculous quantities of data we are generating every day are beyond anything we’ve ever encountered in human history. The volume, velocity, and variety of the data we’re generating is so extreme that the tools to handle it are literally being invented as we go.</p>

<p>And I believe in this data. I believe in the latent power in data to make the world a better place and to give people delight and value and help in ways that we can’t even imagine yet.</p>

<p>And so what I realized is that my answer to The Question—big data—has been sitting right in front of me all along. Following my curiosity made me realize that this was the area I really want to explore, and narrowed an overwhelming world of possibility into a concrete direction that I can walk in and work on (lots in the works that I hope to go public with soon).</p>

<p>Where will your curiosity take you? Follow it.</p>

        <link href="https://andrewskotzko.com/how-to-email-notes-or-ideas-into-scrivener"/>
        <updated>2014-08-21T13:54:14-07:00</updated>
        <id>https://andrewskotzko.com/how-to-email-notes-or-ideas-into-scrivener</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last several months, I’d fallen off the wagon writing-wise due to very heavy client workloads. I’m finally getting back into it after wrapping up a project. Given the restart, I got to wondering about my writing workflow and which tools I use.</p>

<p>In whatever I do (coding, writing, etc) I’m always concerned with tools and establishing a good workflow and rhythm. For me, that means mobility and cross-platform access to what I’m working on. I want my data stored in the cloud so it isn’t tied to any one physical device or location, and so it’s properly backed up off-premises. This protects my work from accidents (or stupidity) well, and gives me flexibility about when, where and how I do my work. I appreciate that.</p>

<p>After a quick chat with <a href="http://twitter.com/scotthurff">Scott</a> (he’s currently finishing a <a href="http://scotthurff.com/perfecting-product-design/">book on product design</a>), I decided to use <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> as the main organizational hub for everything, with all my files stored in <a href="https://db.tt/CNoIMVg">Dropbox</a>. In case you’re unfamiliar with Scrivener, it’s a professional-grade writing suite used by many journalists, authors, researchers, et al. Basically, if you’re doing serious writing, Scrivener is a one-stop shop and damn useful. It is also complex.</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of Scrivener for overall project organization and editing. But I don’t love it for actual writing. The layout is too distracting and its composition mode doesn’t feel focused enough for me. So I pair Scrivener with <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac/">iA Writer</a>, which is my favorite text editor to actually write in. I do this by using <a href="http://iainbroome.com/scrivener-mobile-sync">Scrivener’s external sync via Dropbox</a>, and voila! I have a beautiful cross-platform environment to write in. I also like the idea that my writing is safely stored in Dropbox, and I’m able to work on it anywhere, anytime, from any device. (I wrote this paragraph on my phone while waiting in line at the grocery store, and when I got back to my desk I just synced from Scrivener and carried on writing where I left off on my phone.)</p>

<p><a name="morelink"></a>I got to wondering: <strong>could I somehow easily email ideas into my Scrivener project from wherever I am</strong>?<!-- more -->I often send myself little notes on the go by emailing them into my Evernote account with one tap using the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/captio-email-yourself-1-tap/id370899391?mt=8">Captio app</a>, which is probably the most useful $1.99 I’ve spent on software. (For Android, it looks like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pfalabs&amp;hl=en">Mail Myself</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&amp;hl=en">Google Keep</a> could be good options for similar use case.)</p>

<p>Idea strikes, fire off email to my Evernote in 5 seconds, move on. It works well.</p>

<p>So, <strong>can you quickly email in ideas to a Scrivener project</strong>? Absolutely. Here’s how.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> to create plain text files in Dropbox from the emails I send in. These plain text files then sync into my Scrivener project through the external sync. I use the following external sync config in Scrivener (access from File &gt; Sync &gt; With External Folder… and then choose your Dropbox folder).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/08/sync-config.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, depending on how many projects you have in Scrivener, you may want to:
  * email all ideas into one project, or…
  * be able to email ideas into multiple projects</p>

<p>To do this, you’ll need an IFTTT account (it’s free). Get one <a href="https://ifttt.com/join">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="emailing-all-ideas-into-one-scrivener-project">Emailing all ideas into one Scrivener project</h2>
<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/197602-email-into-scrivener-all-into-one-project">Here is my IFTTT recipe for emailing all ideas into one Scrivener project</a>. For this example, I’ll use my blog project.</p>

<p>A quick note before we dive in:
&gt; In all of the below examples, you will need to specify a path to the folder where IFTTT should make the text file(s). <strong>Have IFTTT create your note text files in same Dropbox folder you use for Scrivener External Sync. Don’t use the folder where your main Scrivener project is saved (assuming they are saved in different folders).</strong></p>

<h3 id="sequence">Sequence:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I email trigger@ifttt.com</li>
  <li>the body of the email appears as a new document in the Ideas folder within my Scrivener project.</li>
  <li>Any attachments (such as a photo) will not be included inline, but there will be a link to them added into the idea so you can paste it in later when you review the idea.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s how it looks in screenshots:</p>

## Emailing ideas into multiple Scrivener projects
If you have multiple Scrivener projects, you’ll likely want the ability to email into each of them independently. <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/197604-email-notes-into-specific-scrivener-project">Here is my IFTTT recipe to email ideas into a specific Scrivener project</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll need to set up a copy of this recipe per project you want to be able to email into.</p>

<p>Here’s an example with my two current projects, “Blog” and “Daily Writing.” The only differences are the hashtag (goes in the subject line of the email you send) and the path to the folder in Dropbox where I want IFTTT to create the documents.</p>

<h3 id="example-send-in-idea-to-the-blog-project">Example: Send in idea to the blog project</h3>
<p>I email IFTTT just as before, but now I put the #blog hashtag in the subject
line.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/08/blog-idea-send-in-2.png" alt="" />&lt;/img&gt;</p>

<p>…and after syncing, there it is!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/08/blog-only-idea.png" alt="" />&lt;/img&gt;</p>

<h3 id="example-send-in-idea-to-the-daily-writing-project">Example: Send in idea to the daily writing project</h3>
<p>I email IFTTT just as before, but now I put the #daily hashtag in the subject
line.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/08/daily-idea-send-in-2.png" alt="" />&lt;/img&gt;</p>

<p>…and after syncing, there it is!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/08/daily-idea.png" alt="" />&lt;/img&gt;</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>And that’s it!</strong> You should now be able to email ideas into your Scrivener projects anywhere, anytime.</p>

<p>Note: there <em>should</em> be a way to compile all emails sent through this process into one file (in case you want one big ideas document, instead of many). Despite several attempts, I couldn’t get this to consistently work right. Files kept getting overwritten or deleted. The issue appears to be related to the file ID system that Scrivener uses under the hood and the way it rewrites filenames when syncing, but I’m not sure. <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/197603-email-into-scrivener-compile-ideas-into-one-doc">Here is the recipe I made for this use case</a> in case you want to debug it. For me, the one-document-per-idea setup is fine.</p>

<p><strong>How do you keep track of your project ideas on the go? Leave a comment below, I’d love to hear other ways of doing this.</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Heads up</strong>: This a long, detailed post (~6,400 words) so you might want to read it somewhere comfy. You can get the gist by skimming the headings and sequence lists, and then diving into the specific sections as you see fit. Be sure to check out the FAQ and resource links/downloads at the end. Skim read time: 5 minutes. Full read time: 32 minutes.</em></p>

<p>From November until March I worked remotely and traveled in South America. Working remotely and exploring the world is something I’ve wanted to do ever since I first learned the term “location independent” as a college sophomore. But until this trip, I’d never done it. So with no lead time, in early November I booked a one-way ticket to Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Just one problem: I didn’t speak Spanish. I took Spanish in high school, but I couldn’t remember anything useful. And I’m not sure I could apply it in conversation even if I could remember it.</p>

<p>Onboard the redeye flight from Miami to Buenos Aires, my lack of Spanish was immediately clear. I sat next to an Argentine man who turned to me and started speaking. Even though he spoke simply, I could not understand him. It had already been an eighteen hour day, and my best intentions failed within ten seconds. Flush with embarrassment, I admitted defeat: “no hablo español.”</p>

<p>Fast-forward six weeks to arrive at one of the proudest moments of the trip: I sitting in a dark little cerveceria named Konna in Bariloche, in Northern Patagonia, drinking beer surrounded by native Spanish speakers. And having real conversations in Spanish. Conversations that went beyond what foods I had eaten, what I thought of the town, and where I was traveling from and to. A real conversation amongst friends in a bar, for 2 hours.</p>

<p><a name="morelink"></a>This was what I’d been working my ass off for.<!-- more --> The crowning point of the night when one of the women at the table, my lovely Spanish teacher Mariela, said that my progress amazed her. After a comment about my love of mate, steak, and naps, she declared that I was <em>Argentino Argentino</em>. I beamed like a kid with his first trophy.</p>

<p>I wasn’t fluent and my Spanish wasn’t perfect, but that wasn’t the point: I was having a blast, <em>actually speaking real Spanish with real Spanish speakers in a real conversation</em>. That is the point: the cultural experience and growth.</p>

<p>So how did a gringo like me go from “no hablo” to “Argentino Argentino”? That’s what this post is all about: my first attempt at hacking language learning, the approach I took, and the lessons. I’ve taught this approach to about twenty other people who have all been able to speed up their progress. While this is a developing process, it’s one that works.</p>

<p>Before we dive into the nuts and bolts of this process, we need to discuss a few assumptions and the mentality of the learner here.</p>

<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>First of all, I assume you have your own reasons for wanting to learn another language. It doesn’t matter what that reason is, but you do need your own. <strong>If you need convincing that learning another language worth your time, or you think that your native culture/language is superior to others, this is not the post for you</strong>.</p>

<p>This is from the perspective of a native English speaker, and it’s intended for an audience of other native English speakers. That said, as far as I can determine the principles in this process apply for any native to target language pairing.</p>

<p>I assume your goal is to use the language as native speakers do, and that you care about conversation and spoken interaction more than writing. This is opposite the approach most people have in school, which focuses on grammar and written work. We’ll do that too, but not until much later.</p>

<p>Finally, I assume you will dedicate time every day to the language learning practice. Thirty minutes a day will yield steady progress, but increasing the amount of time will definitely speed up your progress. But daily practice is essential if you want fast progress.</p>

<h2 id="mentality">Mentality</h2>

<h3 id="whats-on-the-line-by-when">What’s on the line? By when?</h3>
<p>Starting off with the right mentality is critical to having a positive experience with a new language. Having a goal—ideally, with a deadline and/or some sort of stakes, such as a bet—will help you keep moving on days where you’re feeling sluggish.</p>

<p>My goal was “social fluency”—the point where I can express myself naturally and fluidly, across a wide range of social situations, and enjoy myself. From my experience and research, this seems to be around a solid B1/B2 level on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages">Common European Framework</a> scale.</p>

<p>That bar scene in Bariloche was my goal. I didn’t know that it would be in that bar or in that city, but my goal was to have a normal, casual conversation over dinner with friends within eight weeks of landing in Argentina. (That’s a high bar, but I was putting about 4 hours of work in each day on this.) Again, it doesn’t matter what the goal is, but you need to have one.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/03/konna-300x300.jpg" />&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;(The bar where my conversational goal was reached.)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<h3 id="perfect-aint-perfect">Perfect ain’t perfect</h3>
<p>Nobody is perfect, and nobody speaks perfectly—not even native speakers. <em>Especially</em> native speakers. They aren’t perfect. They’re just real.
One of the hardest things in the beginning of speaking a new language is dealing with feeling self-conscious. I know how it feels—you think through every sentence, afraid of the awkward pause when you don’t know how to say something or the person you’re talking with doesn’t understand you. I’ve been there, and yeah, it’s not that fun.</p>

<p>But without fail, the people I’ve met around the world are helpful and friendly toward non-native speakers making a real effort to communicate. They appreciate and encourage it. Think about the last person you spoke to who was not a native English speaker, but was trying hard—were you judging their English? Or were you happy to help them out and thinking that their English was probably better than your Arabic/Russian/Italian/French/? I’m betting on the latter.</p>

<p>Well, guess what? Same things happens when the roles are reversed. People in other cultures all around the world are not judging you, and are usually delighted to help you out. The fastest way over the self-consciousness hurdle is to look friendly and just start speaking. It will all be okay. I like <a href="http://fluentin3months.com">Benny’s</a> take on this: Just. Start. Speaking.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-english-or-your-native-language">Avoid English (or your native language)</h3>
<p>You can’t translate in your head and speak fluidly at the same time. To get to the point of having interactions at their natural pace, you will have to learn to think in your target language. The good news is that this is much easier than it sounds.</p>

<p>But how?</p>

<p>Simple: don’t translate. <a href="http://fluent-forever.com/the-method/no-translation">Thanks to Gabriel for this idea</a>, one of the language learners / teachers that I most admire.</p>

<p>Gabriel nailed this for me. <strong>DO. NOT. TRANSLATE.</strong> Doing so is only training you to depend on your native language as a bridge to your target language. What you want is to train yourself to think and communicate in the target language, without the bridge.</p>

<p>A simple example from Spanish: why would you train yourself to think “house,” then “la casa,” when instead you could just see a house and think “la casa”? The latter is much more efficient and effective, if your goal is fluent communication.</p>

<p>Now, what you’ve been waiting for: the approach.</p>

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>So, how do I actually learn this? The approach I used is a combination of others, plus a few adaptations of my own. This is where you, dear reader, benefit from my quasi-OCD tendency to research the hell out of topics of personal interest: I spent almost 50 hours consuming and testing different research and approaches, and then distilled those into an approach that combines the best of each. I link to the main approaches I combined in the resources section at the end.</p>

<p>With Spanish I followed the same pattern I use when learning anything new. I begin with two questions: 1. What material is the essential core of this topic? 1. Is there a particular sequence I should learn this material in?</p>

<h3 id="find-the-core">Find the core</h3>
<p>Every language shares commonalities because people everywhere are trying to communicate and do the same sorts of things.</p>

<p>Every language has an essential core of words. Learn this core, and you will have a critical building block for all efforts that follow (more on this below).</p>

<h3 id="sequence">Sequence</h3>
<p>This is the sequence that emerged as I worked on this daily for a few months and helped other travelers with their process. I’ve sequenced it according to where you are in the learning process and according to what level you’d like to reach.</p>

<p>About levels and that oh-so-slippery word, “fluency.” Everyone seems to have their own definition of it. I find it useful to hitch real-world goals, like the “social fluency” I mentioned above, to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages">European Common Framework</a> for measuring language proficiency. This makes understanding your level easier, more concrete and measurable. The grid below lays out the levels (click for full-size).</p>

<p><strong>If you do nothing else, just follow the steps in the “getting started” sequence and let the rest follow.</strong></p>

</ol>

<h3 id="zero-to-functional">Zero to functional</h3>
<p>#### #1 - Essentials, followed by interest
I think of learning any new concept like framing a house: you need to build the frame first, and then you can layer the siding onto that frame. With a language, I believe the initial frame is the most common and essential words in the language (i.e. “the,” “that,” “this,” basic numbers, etc.)</p>

<p>One of they foundational principles in this entire approach is to use English as little as possible and <strong><a href="http://fluent-forever.com/the-method/no-translation">do not translate</a></strong>. But, for these first few hundred words, you’ll have to translate. They are the foundation and frame on which everything else must build. You need some words in a language to acquire the rest, and your native language is your bridge to your first words.</p>

<p>So what are the essentials? We tart with Gabriel Wyner, one of my favorite language learning experts, who provides a good base vocabulary list here <a href="http://fluent-forever.com/the-method/vocabulary/base-vocabulary-list/#.UzoTG61dVxs">here</a>. In addition to his basic list, I would add basic numbers, and then two extremely useful types of phrases: connectors, and “skeleton keys.”</p>

<p>First, the essential words: You’ll just need to learn these cold, because they underly everything. You don’t have to focus on them much after the beginning, because you’ll use them so much they’ll become automatic.</p>

<p>Our second category, connectors, are useful for making your conversations seem more natural earlier on. We all use short connective phrases, which fill in conversational gaps and provide transitions between the things we’re actually trying to say. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m not sure</li>
  <li>what do you think?</li>
  <li>well…</li>
  <li>it’s because</li>
  <li>so…</li>
  <li>although</li>
  <li>but</li>
</ul>

<p>Learning these basic phrases earlier will help you in 2 ways: 1) makes you seem like a more natural speaker than you are, so people are more likely to talk with you; and 2) it lets you get other people talking by tossing the ball back to them (such as a connective phrase like “I’m not sure; what do you think?”). Shout out to <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com">Benny</a> for this idea. Learning some of these common phrases saved my ass when I didn’t know what else to say (read: constantly).</p>

<p>Finally, the “skeleton keys,” as I like to call them. These are commonly used phrases to express the most common intentions: I want, I need, I’d like, etc. In other languages that have verb conjugations (most languages other than English, including all romance languages that I know of), this is a ** hack**: in languages, you can use the intentional phrase + an infinitive (un-conjugated) verb to express tons of ideas. Why is this useful? Because when you’re learning a new language, you have enough going through your head anyway: vocabulary, tone, tense, accent, mood, insecurity, etc. It’s much easier to quickly apply vocabulary you’ve learned in the infinitive form by coupling it with an intentional phrase, than it is to worry about conjugating it. You must learn to conjugate and use verbs as they’re intended, but having a way to express an idea without conjugating turns out to be a useful crutch to have in your back pocket.</p>

<p>Depending on how much time you’re putting into this every day, the above material might take you anywhere from one to four weeks to learn. As you practice, you’ll lock in this foundational material quickly. Following that though, I recommend choosing your material from subjects that you’re personally interested in and would learn about anyway in your native language (my example was cooking; cooking classes and recipes in Spanish kept me engaged when I otherwise would have gotten bored).</p>

<h4 id="start-speaking-immediately">#2 - Start speaking, immediately</h4>

<p>This one is self-explanatory. Speak. Speak as much as you possibly can in your target language. Avoid English like the plague.</p>

<p>As a side note, this is one reason that immersion programs or travel to a foreign country can make such a difference in accelerating progress: dramatically reduced opportunities to speak your native language.</p>

<h4 id="commit-to-the-sounds-and-accents">#3 - Commit to the sounds and accents</h4>
<p>After a few weeks in Buenos Aires, I was hanging out with my Spanish teacher, Gisela, and we went to a polo tournament, which for the record, was fantastic.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/03/polo-300x300.jpg" />&lt;/img&gt;</p>

<p>She insisted I try the tramontaña flavor of the famous local ice cream company, and so of course I was dispatched to buy two cones. She followed along just to see what would happen, and proceeded to have a laughing fit as I royally fucked it up. The guy at the counter had no clue what I was saying, and I just kept trying because I was felt determined to pull this off.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/03/tramontana-150x150.png" />&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;The ice cream flavor I royally messed up.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Afterwards, when I found Gisela again—with the wrong flavors of ice cream, by the way—she was still laughing. “What’s so funny?,” I asked. And between giggles, she recounted that what was so funny was that I was using all the right words and grammatical structures, but the guy behind the counter still had no idea what the hell I was saying.</p>

<p>The moral of the story? <strong>Having the right words and grammar is not enough</strong>. If you say them all wrong, it doesn’t matter if your vocabulary and grammar are perfect: <strong>no one will understand you</strong>, defeating the whole point. It turned out I was making two common mistakes:</p>

<p>First, I was too quiet. Many people whose first instinct is to speak , loudly and slowly when speaking to a non-native English speaker do the exact opposite when the roles are reversed. I certainly did: I was practically meek, which is not a word people would use to describe my usual manner. It’s a strange catch-22: afraid of messing up what I was trying to say, I was too quiet, and therein messed up what I was trying to say.</p>

<p>Second, I was speaking like a gringo. I had a terrible accent that did not at all resemble that of a native Spanish speaker. There are two solutions here: the first, and more important, is to mimic. When you are learning, don’t just mimic the words and structures: mimic the accent of whomever you’re learning from. This means leaning into the <em>sounds</em>, mannerisms, and emphases like a native speaker does. This will feel weird at first because you will not sound like yourself to yourself. Then it will feel fun, because people will suddenly understand you better and will eventually mistake you for a local, which has a host of other travel benefits.</p>

<p>Commit to the sounds and accent from day one. First of all, committing to it from day one means you don’t have to go back and try to change it later. More importantly, it will result in being understood better and in being treated better wherever you go. WIN.</p>

<h4 id="separate-learning-and-review">#4 - Separate learning and review</h4>
<p>This is a key point when learning anything, not just languages: don’t try to learn something new and lock it into long-term memory at the same time. New knowledge takes time to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation">consolidated and transferred to long-term memory</a>, and initial learning is all about getting it locked into short term memory and reviewing at the right intervals so that it efficiently transfers to long-term memory.</p>

<h5 id="learning">Learning</h5>
<p>You need to constrain the amount of new material you try to take in. The brain can only take in so much new information in a given day. I recommend learning 15 new words or phrases per day (30 words/day if you’re feeling aggressive).</p>

<p>But how much vocab do I have to learn? <strong>Much less than you think.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://davies-linguistics.byu.edu/ling485/for_class/hispling_final.htm">This study by Mark Davies at BYU</a> investigated word frequency in Spanish to determine how many words were necessary to understand the majority of native material. While this was Spanish-focused, as far as I know the pattern holds true across languages (given that at the general day-to-day level of language, people everywhere are all pretty much saying the same things, just in different languages).
I came across many references to this study while researching methods, so I dug into it. Here are the shocking results, broken out by whether you want to pace yourself or go fast.</p>

<p>Just to drive this home one more time: <strong>if you choose your words well and learn 30 per day, you will have enough vocab to understand 95% of the spoken language in 3 months (100 days). That is an amazing ROI on your time.</strong> Check out the chart below (and the full study <a href="http://davies-linguistics.byu.edu/ling485/for_class/hispling_final.htm">here</a>):</p>

<h5 id="review">Review</h5>
<p>This is where I clue you into one of my secret weapons: <a href="http://www.ankisrs.net">Anki</a>. Anki is one of my favorite pieces of software in existence. It is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition_software">leading open-source Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) program</a> on the market—free, and cross-platform. What is SRS? Think of flashcards on steroids, but managed by a computer instead of by hand. It’s the most effective tool I’ve found yet for locking information into long-term memory for incredible recall.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to turbocharge your ability to retain new material that you learn (like vocabulary and key phrases), use Anki.</strong> Ignore this one at your own peril.</p>

<h4 id="practice-every-day">#5 - Practice every day</h4>
<p>Pretty self-explanatory. When you’re learning a new language. you are literally changing how your brain is wired. That takes daily practice and dedication. This needs to just become part of your day if you’re serious about it. Locking in new habits is beyond the scope of this post, but I recommend checking out <a href="http://www.andrewskotzko.com/beginners-mind-on-demand/">Beginner’s Mind, on Demand</a> and <a href="http://tinyhabits.com">TinyHabits</a> for more there.</p>

<p>If you do this right, this is an enjoyable part of the day that you’ll look forward to. Especially because you’ll see, feel, and hear yourself improving every single day. And that is motivating.</p>

<h3 id="achieving-social-fluency--advanced-levels">Achieving social fluency &amp; advanced levels</h3>
<p>#### #6 - Move to native materials, ASAP
This is an extension of Do Not Translate. As soon as you possibly can (that is, from day one) use reading and viewing materials that were made for the native audience. In the beginning, this will mean using simple native reading and viewing materials.</p>

<p>Very quickly though, you’ll get bored with the material you’re using. This is normal, don’t worry about it. What do you do instead? Just consume the media you would in your native language, but in your target language. I learned a TON reading stories about cooking and learning recipes in Spanish for some cooking classes I took.</p>

<p>When you use material that you naturally enjoy, it doesn’t feel like work. To me it feels more like unlocking a fun cheat code where you get to do the thing you like and learn this language too.</p>

<p>As soon as possible (once you start to be able to have actual conversations in the target language), you want to get a monolingual dictionary so that you begin to learn new words and phrases using the target language itself.</p>

<h4 id="get-as-much-passive-exposure-as-possible">#7 - Get as much passive exposure as possible</h4>
<p>This is the area where immersion is most useful. By hearing the sounds of the language in the street, in music, on TV, and seeing it written everywhere, you start to pick up nuances (especially pronunciation) that is hard to replicate without this level of exposure.</p>

<p>But what if you can’t travel to a country where your target language is spoken? (time, money, etc). The good news: you don’t even have to, thanks to virtual immersion.</p>

<h5 id="virtual-immersion">Virtual immersion</h5>
<p>Thanks to the web, you can create an environment that gives you most of the benefits of immersion, without leaving home. If you’re going to watch TV, do it in your target language. If you listen to music while working, listen to music in your target language (I, for one, am a fan of the “Intro to Argentine Rock” Rdio playlist). You can find great radio from around the world on the web at <a href="http://tunein.com">TuneIn</a>, the <a href="http://bbc.co.uk">BBC</a>, or on YouTube.</p>

<p>This is where I want to give a shoutout to…</p>

<h4 id="use-the-telenovela-method">#8 - Use the Telenovela method</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Telenovela-Method-Spanish-Online-ebook/dp/B00GXSS4CO">“The Telenovela Method”</a> is a clever and fun way to learn a lot of your target language. (The resource lists he includes in that book are worth the price of purchase on their own.)</p>

<p>The gist of the Telenovela method is to use material (TV shows, movies, books) that was created for a native audience, and to work your way through them slowly. Scene-by-scene or sentence-by-sentence, learn everything you need to fully understand the material. Add it to Anki once you truly understand it. Rinse &amp; repeat.</p>

<p>This, on its own, is a powerful way to build your vocabulary and grammatical skills and to pick up the intonations and vocal mannerisms of a native speaker. But I recommend it as an augmentation of the other, more conversation-based techniques I’m outlining here. If you only have time for one, choose those, as it will get you actually speaking in and using the language, which is the actual point anyway (not much use if you don’t use it…).</p>

<h4 id="dont-study-grammar-until-you-have-a-grasp-of-the-language">#9 - Don’t study grammar until you have a grasp of the language</h4>
<p>Starting with grammar is akin to the idea that if you memorize enough rules of a game, you’ll know how to play it. Just because I know the rules of football, or cricket, or swimming, does not mean I am any good at those skills. Why would the skill of language be any different? (Remember: it is just a skill, and therefore learnable and trainable like any other.)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/03/combo-300x160.png " />&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Where would you rather learn the game?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>You will need an excellent grammar book and to spend time internalizing this part of the language. But grammar is boring as hell until you actually have personal experience in the language to use it on. Once you’ve been using and speaking the language every day for a few weeks and are underway, THEN you can return to grammar. With this basis, it will actually help you understand what you’ve already seen as opposed to confusing you with a bunch of rules that seem arbitrary and out of context.</p>

<h4 id="consider-hiring-a-teacher-or-finding-a-language-buddy">#10 - Consider hiring a teacher or finding a language buddy</h4>
<p>Having another person there who knows the language can be immensely helpful, especially as you progress to a more nuanced level. This can cost as little as $5/hour on <a href="http://www.italki.com">iTalki</a> or it can be free with a language exchange buddy. Effort determines outcomes here.</p>

<h4 id="force-yourself-to-think-in-the-target-language">#11 - Force yourself to think in the target language</h4>
<p>This one is self-explanatory: as you’re walking around during the day, trying to think in your target language.</p>

<p>Start simply: when you see a dog, think the word for “dog” in your target language (without translating). Keep doing this and gradually you will build up the mental muscle and practice of thinking directly in your target language without translating.</p>

<hr />

<p>Learning a new language doesn’t need to be scary, or expensive, or this all-consuming thing that takes over your life (although that can be fun, too).</p>

<p>Combine the highest-frequency material with a good learning approach, use it every day, and retain what you have learned. I share a ton of resource links in the FAQ below—if I’ve missed something good, let me know and I’ll add it.</p>

<p>There’s a big, wide, happy world waiting for you to come out and unlock new cultural and travel experiences. This can be your key.</p>

<p>Good luck! I hope you’ve found this useful. Please leave a comment below and let me know how this works for you, what works, what doesn’t, and any questions you have.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3 id="where-can-i-download-anki-decks">Where can I download Anki decks?</h3>
<p>The truth is, you will have much better experience and enjoy better performance if you make your own cards. There are several reasons for this: 1. Anki is a phenomenal tool for retaining what you’ve learned, but not for initially learning something. There is an initial foundation of understanding and retention that occurs when you actually learn something on your own. You skip this if you get your cards “off the shelf.” Also keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Having to catch up on tons of cards can quickly get overwhelming and take a lot of time. If you’re aggressively using downloaded decks, you may soon find yourself in a position like me where I missed 2 days and came back to having to review almost 1,000 flashcards for Spanish alone in one morning review session. Not so fun.</li>
  <li>Other people are often not as careful as you in creating / maintaining their decks. I have memorized things that were wrong because I was using someone else’s deck.</li>
  <li>If the image on your card is at all ambiguous (which will happen often), you may not remember what it was actually supposed to mean, since you didn’t make the card. This leads to false positive/negatives, which messes up the review patterns and schedule determined by the Anki algorithm.</li>
</ol>

<p>That said, I totally get it if you want to download one of the many decks on a specific topic that are available online <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">here</a>. You can also download my personal, hand-crafted Spanish deck (with images and media) here.</p>

<p>I’ll quote <a href="http://fluent-forever.com/personal-anki-decks/">Gabriel’s advice on learning from a downloaded deck</a>, which I think is spot-on:
&gt; …that being said, if you’re dead set against making your own deck because you have no hands or something, you can make using someone else’s deck more effective by splitting the memorization and learning steps…
&gt;
&gt; Download the deck, install it, and suspend every single card. Go through the suspended cards and choose the ones that are clear in meaning to you. Use a dictionary to make sure they mean what you think they mean. Un-suspend those cards and learn them over a week or so. Now go back and un-suspend more cards. Keep doing this, and you’ll eventually learn all the concepts, and then be able to use Anki to effectively memorize them.</p>

<h3 id="how-should-i-make-anki-cards">How should I make Anki cards?</h3>
<p>Generally, follow Gabriel’s advice <a href="http://fluent-forever.com/create-better-flashcards">here</a>. The key points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use images for anything possible.</li>
  <li>If a word is at all ambiguous, use two images. This way it’ll be clear during review what you’re looking at.)</li>
  <li>Use definite articles (example: “la ala”, not just “ala” for “wing”). This is very important if definite articles are less common in your native language than in your target language, (such as English vs Spanish / most romance languages).</li>
  <li><strong>Simple is better.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-random-tricks-helped">What random tricks helped?</h3>
<p>Reading comic books. They’re written for a native, casual audience, and they are almost 100% dialogue. Comic books do a great job capturing the way the language is actually used by real people in their everyday lives. Plus, they have awesome art and cool stories.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/03/comic-300x300.jpg" />&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Comic books: True native material + all dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>If comic books aren’t your thing, any relatively dialogue-heavy text will do, like a children’s book (especially if you can get a parallel text in your native language when you can’t understand something). “The Little Prince” was and is a favorite of mine, now in two languages.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/the-best-online-dictionary-for-learning-any-language-google-image/">Using Google Images as a foreign language dictionary</a> works well, especially once you adapt to the “don’t translate” principle.</p>

<p>Make a one-page self bio in the target language and go through it with a native speaker to improve it, make it fluid, and learn how to pronounce it right. Once you’ve got it, practice and memorize it, and voila! you’ve basically memorized / scripted your answers to the first 5 minutes of meeting anyone new, and done so in a way that will make you sound more native and make them more likely to respond positively to you. Winning.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-structure-a-good-language-exchange-with-a-conversation-partner">How do I structure a good language exchange with a conversation partner?</h3>
<p>This is an art unto itself, and I think the reigning master is Andrew Tracey (he covers this and lots of other great resources in his book).</p>

<p>That said, you want to keep it interesting and engaging for both you and your partner. You’ll want to switch back and forth between languages, say every 15-20 minutes.</p>

<p>If you want to go the conversational route, <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s8/sh/e91954b6-3668-443c-8aba-f444308c7847/1a5dbc7a801bc05537483da540841265">here is a list of good conversation starters that I’ve compiled</a>, ranging from lighthearted to heavyweight topics. Further, here are other <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s8/sh/035b2350-5bc4-4d07-8bda-e372ed6de8be/82a1459862548678d454491ffb85832f">tips I’ve compiled from various resources about how to structure a good exchange</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-retain-what-ive-learned">How do I retain what I’ve learned?</h3>
<p>Frankly, I wouldn’t worry all that much about retention for now. If you’re actually using the language &amp; Anki every day (which you should be) then you’ll already be retaining a lot of what you know. And the rest of the language you have learned isn’t gone, it’s just hibernating. I like Tim’s recommendations for reactivating a hibernating language <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/09/20/how-to-resurrect-your-high-school-spanish-or-any-language-plus-be-on-the-cbs-early-show/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="where-do-i-go-for-more">Where do I go for more?</h3>
<p>Here’s a compiled list of resources that I used all the time.</p>

<h3 id="what-didnt-work">What didn’t work?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Focusing on grammar first, or even early</li>
  <li>Writing to use the language without getting it corrected. Use <a href="http://www.lang-8.com/">Lang-8</a> for this; write short, fun entries using whatever words or phrases you’re focusing on or struggling with. You’ll remember them better and get corrections on how to use them, all in one go!</li>
  <li>Trying to write or read about something I wasn’t fundamentally interested in (like some boring historical event); to stay engaged, I needed material that appealed to my interests</li>
  <li>not using definite articles in Anki: in English, we don’t use definite articles (“the”) anywhere near as much as other languages do.</li>
  <li>Translating: <strong>this is the big trap that I and damn near everybody I know has fallen into</strong>. Translating is slow, tiring, and boring for your conversational partner. Moreover, your goal is NOT to train yourself to translate. Your goal is to train yourself to communicate fluidly in this new language. After those initial 300-400 base vocab words, translation is only slowing you down and making you dependent on a crutch you don’t need.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-if-im-just-going-on-a-quick-trip-somewhere-and-dont-want-to-learn-the-whole-language">What if I’m just going on a quick trip somewhere, and don’t want to learn the whole language?</h3>

<p>Fair enough. You’re going on vacation for two weeks—worth bothering to learn anything? I’d say so. There is immense value in getting the basic words and phrases (i.e. the initial 400).</p>

<p>Without fail, putting forth an honest attempt to speak in the local language will get you treated better than the opposite. You’ll get better deals, more sympathy, more help, and maybe some amazing new cultural experiences that locals invite you to join in.</p>

<p>So, yes, at least learn something. A little bit of effort here can have an outsized impact on the quality and fun of your trip.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-flaws-with-this-approach">What are the flaws with this approach?</h3>

<p>You’ll quickly become more interesting and attractive, so your social calendar may get quite full. Don’t come whining to me when you’re too busy doing awesome new stuff.</p>

<p>But in all seriousness, I can think of two things about this approach that you may consider a flaw, depending on your personal goal:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I <strong>heavily</strong> prioritize spoken language over written language.</li>
  <li>I don’t know how this process would need to change to get to a true level of mastery with a given language. This approach is aimed at getting to social fluency and general fluency, not aimed at the level of being able to give a 30 minute highly technical testimony in front of Congress in the language.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-much-will-this-cost-me">How much will this cost me?</h3>
<p>This process can work on its own, for free and without paying for any classes. Many of the best resources are free (I listed them above). That said, your progress may speed up if you find a good teacher to help you with more advanced grammar and linguistic nuance after you already have a solid, working handle on the language.</p>

<h3 id="which-language-should-i-learn">Which language should I learn?</h3>
<p>Whichever you actually feel motivated to and interested in. Whether you want to learn a language to surprise a loved one, unlock new career opportunities, or just because you like the sound of it—all these are perfectly good reasons.</p>

<p>That said, when choosing a language you will want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider the sounds: if your target language has sounds that do not exist in your native language, it is going to be harder. There are tongue and throat muscles and patterns that you just don’t have right now.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/11/07/how-to-learn-but-not-master-any-language-in-1-hour-plus-a-favor/">Deconstruct the language with the help of a native (or Google)</a> to see how different its structure is from your native language. Is the word order different? Do modifiers go before or after that which they modify?</li>
  <li>Consider the language difficulty charts. The US Foreign Service Institute and Defense Language Institute chart out languages based on Category 1-4, with each step up in number representing the expectation that it will take twice as long as a language at the level below it.</li>
</ul>

        <link href="https://andrewskotzko.com/permission-to-fall"/>
        <updated>2014-02-20T06:45:19-08:00</updated>
        <id>https://andrewskotzko.com/permission-to-fall</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/02/falling.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In life, I regret the things I didn’t do more than the missteps I made along the way.<br />- David Stanley</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the last three months, I traveled throughout South America. Despite what my <a href="http://instagram.com/skotzko">Instagram photos</a> may suggest, for the first month I was on the road, I was not enjoying it. Everything was new and stressful. There were no familiar places or friends to fall back on. The lack of regular schedules shot my all routines to hell. I felt lonely without my friends, and had no idea what I was doing. I drank too much, and exercised too little.</p>

<h2 id="searching-far-from-home">Searching, far from home</h2>
<p>I had gone away to get out of the tech scene for a while, for a change of pace and scenery. I had recently left <a href="http://chill.com">Chill</a>, where I’d driven myself at a maniacal pace for almost three years. I needed time and space to think, refresh, and get some perspective.</p>

<p>But I was 6,121 miles away, and it wasn’t working.</p>

<p>On the night of December 21st, I remember calling <a href="http://mattdsandler.com/">Matt</a> from my apartment in Buenos Aires. I’d talked myself in circles, about whether this crazy trip was still a good idea.</p>

<p>Should I just go back to California and take another job? Should I scrap the idea of trying to build something of my own? I was minutes away from booking a trip back to the USA so I could spend the holidays with friends and family.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Matt helped me see that I was just looking for familiarity. But why wasn’t I enjoying myself in Buenos Aires, a city full of steak, beautiful women, and dreams? <!-- more --> At first, the answer seemed simple. I wasn’t committed to letting go of control and to seeing what the trip would bring me. I was holding back. I was also suffering from social isolation, and a bit too much time on my hands.</p>

<p>But that wasn’t the real reason. I know how to let go and accept what comes.</p>

<h2 id="permission">Permission</h2>
<p>The real reason was simpler and deeper: I needed to give myself permission. Permission to feel new emotions. Permission to try on new experiences. Permission to fail.</p>

<p>At first, I dismissed this realization. There’s no way that it could be that simple. Of course I give myself permission to enjoy this. I got myself here, right?</p>

<p>But as the weeks wore on, the quiet reminder inside insisting that I give myself permission refused dismissal.</p>

<p>Whenever I shied away from embracing an experience or taking emotional risk—whether it be asking out a woman I liked, striking up a conversation in Spanish with a stranger, or allowing myself to truly enjoy a fun moment with new friends that I’d soon part ways from—the reminder never faltered: “Give yourself permission. Give yourself permission. Give yourself permission.”</p>

<p>Those words, the overriding theme of my trip, changed my perspective on risk.</p>

<p>Giving myself permission to embrace joy also meant that I needed to give myself permission to fall. To leave the constrained band of emotion which contains most of daily life, and to be susceptible to a full range of emotions. To accept the real possibility of failure and getting hurt, knowing I will find a way to get back up if that happens. Never before this had I thought, “it’s okay if I fail here.”</p>

<h2 id="the-falls-make-the-jumps">The falls make the jumps</h2>
<p>Without the fall, there is no leap. Without the leap, there is no bridging the gaps between where we are and where we want to go. Without crossing these gaps, there is no progress, no growth. <a href="http://www.andrewskotzko.com/about/">And without growth, there is death.</a></p>

<p>Thus, without the fall, there can be no life.</p>

<p>We each have opportunities to grow, and to do, and to be. The size of these opportunities is so great as to be scary. We all want to be successful in realizing our hopes and projects in the world. But we’re scared of falling.</p>

<p>I was afraid of the pain of falling down. The pain of failing at something I tried. Of people laughing at me. I still feel that. I think all creators do.</p>

<p>But, I’ve learned that the pain of regret, of not trying, of not going for it, of not kissing the girl or pitching the idea when the moment was ripe, is searing. And far worse, it lingers.</p>

<p>The only safety net is our own survival ability and the ability to pick ourselves back up.</p>

<p>It’s the falls that make the jumps.</p>

<p>Only one gatekeeper left.</p>

<p>And so, the real question:</p>

<p>Will I leap?</p>

If there’s ever a time of year when we want to feel human connection, it’s around Valentine’s Day. And connection requires vulnerability and honesty, experiencing the world through another’s eyes.</p>

<p>Here are two questions that I’ve found helpful in authentically opening up my work and thinking to others over the last few months, which has led to some wonderful connections and conversations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What do the things that I feel compelled to do tell me about myself?</li>
  <li>Why do I want this thing that I want?</li>
</ol>

<p>Both are variants on the same theme: understanding what is driving you from within. Being honest with yourself, and in turn, others. At having a chance of doing this thing you want to do authentically and humanly.</p>

<p>And the experience of authentic human connection, of a shared human experience that means something?</p>

<p>In a digital world, it turns out that is what our analog hearts are really after.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a long day in transit, I wanted to share a note of lessons I wrote in hopes that my future niece learns them earlier than I did:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The world is both big and small and travel is one of the best things you can do for yourself. Embrace it. Get out into it.</li>
  <li>Learn to pack light. You need much less than you think.</li>
  <li>Keep asking “why?” and consider it as a major warning sign if someone in authority doesn’t want to answer, gets frustrated when you ask, or can’t answer the question without a tautology.</li>
  <li>“Because that’s just how it’s done” is the worst answer to this question.</li>
  <li>Learn to listen for and recognize the quiet voice inside of you that you know is your soul.</li>
  <li>Do whatever you have to in order to protect and cherish this voice. Some people will try to crush it.</li>
  <li>Avoid those people. They aren’t worth your time and are toxic for you.</li>
  <li>Basic personal finance and statistics will save your ass.</li>
  <li>Avoid debt like the plague. It is one of the oldest forms of slavery in the world, but is made to appear as “normal.”</li>
  <li>On that note, don’t watch TV, or whatever its equivalent is by the time you’re old enough to. It will try to lie to you about almost everything that is important and make you feel bad about yourself so you buy crap you don’t need or believe in ideas that don’t serve you.</li>
  <li>Curiosity and “dangerous questions” are what we need more of. All progress depends on these.</li>
  <li>Ignorance is not the same as stupidity. If you don’t know something, find out. Ask, learn, repeat.</li>
  <li>Avoid anyone who tries to make you feel bad for being curious, learning something, or trying to improve yourself and the world. This person is an energy-sucking vampire.</li>
</ol>

<p>Love,<br />
Uncle Andrew</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nobody likes to start something with a failure.</p>

<p>Especially a public something.</p>

<p>I just did that.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>
<p>A few months ago, I announced that I was going to begin publishing my ongoing experiments. In <a href="http://www.andrewskotzko.com/2013/06/25/announcing-personal-experiments/">experiment 1</a>, I hoped to make some physical changes and feel better, have more energy, etc. The plan was to workout and quantify my progress both inside and outside my body.</p>

<p>It was a good idea, a good intention, and decently planned out. But it was too much, too soon.</p>

<p>I was trying to do everything all at once. I was working out intensely, at least 4 days a week. I was tracking everything I ate down to the calorie and macronutrient profile. I was tracking my steps, commute times, blood markers, mood, hours of sleep, and basically everything else I could think of. My OCD-tendencies blossomed into fullness on this one, to my partial regret. I don’t regret the things I started to track, or the intentions I came up with: I was truly seeking useful data. But I do regret the way I did it: all at once. The other mistake I made was to make it a BIG thing (to my mind) that was fairly long term (4 months).</p>

<p>I’m declaring Experiment 1 a failure because I was not able to finish the experiment and fell off the wagon.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<p>Here is a link to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApBq5nqLSn9MdDBIdFdrZGZzQUY0UzFBUVh5emtSOWc&amp;usp=sharing">spreadsheet where I was tracking everything</a>.</p>

<p>Looking over those documents, a few things are clear: I was more consistent at doing the workouts than I was at tracking it all. In fact, I found the tracking aspect exhausting due to how manual everything was. I kept doing the workouts and diet for over a month but quit all the tracking after about 2 full weeks. Automation of data collection and aggregation is going to be essential for future efforts in this space.</p>

<p>I was surprised by how much I liked doing an ongoing log of thoughts in the observations. It was a good way to vent, and in retrospect, lets me see the arc of the experiment. <a href="http://www.andrewskotzko.com/about/">Let me know</a> one thing that stands out to you.</p>

<p>I do take away a few lessons from the experiment that are useful:</p>

<!-- more -->

<ul>
  <li>I am strongly reminded to start new projects small and let them progress incrementally, rather than trying to force a new effort to be fully matured immediately.</li>
  <li>I was interested in using the project as a hands-on way to learn more about the practical applications and challenges of the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self (QS) movement</a>. The punchline: there is massive value to be derived from collecting and implementing personal analytics, but it won’t take off until it is much easier than it is today. Automation is critical and probably a necessary component to realize the promise of QS.</li>
  <li>Everyone wants to be more awesome. Although QS and self-experimentation can involve private areas of our lives, people are fundamentally interested in exploring this field and using it to improve their lives. I had more in-person conversations about this experiment than almost any of my previous ones (which were not written up publicly).</li>
  <li>I must be wary of my OCD tendencies around data and research, and never allow augmentation / secondary efforts (e.g. extensive logging) to overwhelm the real work (working out consistently).</li>
  <li>I now think that the key to making any big change is to make incremental small changes, such that the “new thing” isn’t some new external thing at all, but gradually just becomes part of who I am. After all, it’s easy and natural to do things that are “just who we are” without needing extra motivation. The trick is to hack that process with small changes that become habits and add up.</li>
</ul>

<p>At some point in the future, I’ll re-approach this experiment in a more incremental fashion rather than trying to boil the ocean. That will also have the added benefit of isolating the variables which is a better approach to data-driven experimentation anyway.</p>

<p>Onward.</p>

        <link href="https://andrewskotzko.com/do-i-need-a-makeover"/>
        <updated>2013-06-25T11:27:06-07:00</updated>
        <id>https://andrewskotzko.com/do-i-need-a-makeover</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last three or four months, I’ve noticed my energy levels decreasing and it has freaked me out a little bit. It’s not that I have felt bad; I’ve just felt less and less <em>good</em>. I also noticed that my drive at work and sex drive were lower than they had been in the past, and having just turned 27 last week, that shouldn’t be the case.</p>

<p><strong>WTF?</strong></p>

<p>Early this year, I developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fasciitis">plantar fasciitis (PF)</a> in my left foot—if you’re not familiar with it, PF is when the connective tissue between your heel and the ball of your foot becomes inflamed. You do not want this. I got it in January and spent a few months rehabbing my foot, only to have it come roaring back once I started training seriously again. (Aside: I’ve since figured out the root cause of the PF and will share the fix soon.) My hunch is that my decreased levels of exercise over the last few months are the cause of the energetic changes I’d been experiencing.</p>

<p>Clueless, I started digging. My research led me to looking at biomarkers and hormone levels in my body. I became very concerned when I discovered that my testosterone levels had dropped almost 30% in the last four months. Hooked, I started looking at cortisol, insulin, and other blood markers, searching for clues.</p>

<p>In my research, I came across the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Man-2-0-Engineering-Alpha-Muscle/dp/006222087X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372145538&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=engineering+the+alpha">“Engineering the Alpha (ETA),”</a> which, despite its title, is actually backed by solid science. The gist of the ETA approach is this: Hormones run your body and control how you feel, so if you can manipulate your hormones through diet and exercise, it is logical that you can trigger sweeping changes in the body.</p>

<p>Now, I’ve always been a little obsessed with optimization, particularly self-optimization, so this is in my sweet spot. I really can’t help it–I’m constantly asking questions, thinking, and tweaking my approach to the world. I’m always looking for a better way to solve problems, and exploring new methods of <a href="/2013/03/31/a-roadmap/">achieving my goals</a>.</p>

<p>And so…</p>

<h2 id="announcing-experiment-1-a-manly-makeover">Announcing Experiment 1: A manly makeover</h2>

<p>No, I’m not having those guys from ‘Queer Eye For The Straight Guy’ come into my house and swap out all my furniture and clothing. One, I like what I’ve got. Two, I think that show is long dead. Sorry Mom, I know you liked it. Third, I have a different kind of makeover in mind.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>What I am doing is undertaking the ETA program full-on, to the letter, and seeing what happens. I’m tracking as much of the inputs and outputs as I can. I baselined my biomarkers, I’m logging all food and workouts, and will continue to keep it updated.</p>

<p>Going forward, I’m going to make my experiments public, as part of the ongoing process of exploring and sharing what I learn. That’s right, I’m gonna play with myself in public. My hope is to (a) learn something and (b) share what I learn in a useful way. I welcome your feedback, suggestions, and criticism of these experiments. We’re going open-book here.</p>

<p>Three components are at the heart of this exploration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A sense of adventure and curiosity. After all, this shit is supposed to be fun, right?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experimentation: breakthroughs often come from structured experiments, and experiments need…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data. In these experiments, I’ll capture, share, and explore my data in relation to other data that I can track down.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Experiment 1 announced: today, June 25th. Experiment 1 began: one week ago, June 18th.</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>

<p>My goal is to improve the following biomarkers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Testosterone</strong>: I am concerned because my testosterone levels dropped almost 30% in the last four months, with no clear reason. Thankfully they were very high before so I’m still in a good range after the drop, but I’d like to get these back up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cortisol</strong>: I need to lower my stress levels. They are above the normal range and cortisol wreaks havoc on energy levels, drive, sex drive, and fat-burning ability. No bueno.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Body fat</strong>: I’ve been hovering around the 19% body fat level, which isn’t terrible, but I could certainly be in better shape. I’m not in bad shape, but I’m not ripped either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Energy levels</strong>: this is the hardest one to nail down because it is both subjective and partly psychological. But I’d like to have more energy throughout the day rather than having a primary burst of energy in the morning and then dragging ass for the rest of the day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>My kickoff observation is that I am excited about the promise this holds, intimidated by how to track it all, and also realize that in a sense this is bad science: there are a lot of variables at play here. If anything, this is an experiment in the realities of self-tracking, a core area of <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">the quantified self</a> that captivates me.</p>

<h3 id="the-rules-of-engagement">The rules of engagement</h3>

<p>I am to follow the ETA program of diet and exercise as closely as possible. There are four phases, each 1 month long, with very specific diet and exercise protocols. I’ll go into more detail in the experiment log but know that it begins with a short, very low-carb phase (an “insulin reset”) and circuit training in the gym.</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>Even for someone who is deeply interested in self-tracking, this one is a little intimidating. There is a lot of data to be captured, tracked, and collated.</p>

<p>To start, I’ll be aggregating data in a Google spreadsheet, logging my food with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lose-it!/id297368629?mt=8">Lose It</a>, and checking into daily activities with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lift/id530911645?mt=8">Lift</a>. I may use <a href="http://www.moves-app.com/">Moves</a>, an app that passively tracks steps and has proven itself as accurate as a FitBit in that regard. I baselined my blood biomarkers in a Labcorp test via <a href="https://www.accesalabs.com/">Accesa Labs</a>, but I’m excited about the possibility of cheaper testing tools such as <a href="http://talking20.com">Talking20</a>.</p>

<p>And, as always, I’ll be using my beloved <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/captio-email-yourself-1-tap/id370899391?mt=8">Captio</a> for notetaking. Jotter looks like a decent equivalent for all you Android people.</p>

<h3 id="expectations--hypothesis">Expectations &amp; Hypothesis</h3>

<p>It’s not an experiment if you can’t be wrong. So, a falsifiable hypothesis: I project that my bodyfat will decrease by at least 5%, my stress levels will come back into the normal range, and my testosterone will increase by at least 20%.</p>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>

<p>I will be updating this <a href="/experiments/experiment-log-1-a-manly-makeover">daily observation log</a>. Check back for more details and <a href="http://twitter.com/askotzko">hit me up on Twitter</a> if you’re wondering about something.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
