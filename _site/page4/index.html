        <p>Over the last three or four months, I’ve noticed my energy levels decreasing and it has freaked me out a little bit. It’s not that I have felt bad; I’ve just felt less and less <em>good</em>. I also noticed that my drive at work and sex drive were lower than they had been in the past, and having just turned 27 last week, that shouldn’t be the case.</p> <p><strong>WTF?</strong></p> <p>Early this year, I developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fasciitis">plantar fasciitis (PF)</a> in my left foot—if you’re not familiar with it, PF is when the connective tissue between your heel and the ball of your foot becomes inflamed. You do not want this. I got it in January and spent a few months rehabbing my foot, only to have it come roaring back once I started training seriously again. (Aside: I’ve since figured out the root cause of the PF and will share the fix soon.) My hunch is that my decreased levels of exercise over the last few months are the cause of the energetic changes I’d been experiencing.</p> <p>Clueless, I started digging. My research led me to looking at biomarkers and hormone levels in my body. I became very concerned when I discovered that my testosterone levels had dropped almost 30% in the last four months. Hooked, I started looking at cortisol, insulin, and other blood markers, searching for clues.</p> <p>In my research, I came across the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Man-2-0-Engineering-Alpha-Muscle/dp/006222087X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372145538&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=engineering+the+alpha">“Engineering the Alpha (ETA),”</a> which, despite its title, is actually backed by solid science. The gist of the ETA approach is this: Hormones run your body and control how you feel, so if you can manipulate your hormones through diet and exercise, it is logical that you can trigger sweeping changes in the body.</p> <p>Now, I’ve always been a little obsessed with optimization,...

        <p>I hate seeing good people buy bad things. It’s not my business what someone buys with their money or attention, but I do care about the work that a creator/marketer presents to a paying public. To use a food analogy, I feel especially angry when the presentation is all sizzle and no steak; when a piece of low-quality beef that was hurriedly and unlovingly prepared is being billed as a bone-in ribeye that’s been painstakingly marinated, seared, and slow-cooked into a medium-rare oblivion of bliss.</p>

<p>Quality matters. But so does presentation. Substance without style is never even looked at. But style without substance is a blatant lie.</p>

<p>Here’s what got me thinking…</p>

<h2 id="is-it-fair-to-judge-a-book-by-its-cover">Is it fair to judge a book by its cover?</h2>

<p>An acquaintance of mine from years ago recently published a book. I saw a very excited post on Facebook about it, overwhelmed with emotion about the book “hitting the bestseller list.” I was curious and excited because I like this person and wanted to see what he had made, so I clicked through to check it out. Immediately, my bullshit meter started pinging based on the design of the website and book. But I wanted to give it a chance. After all, he was self-publishing this book, and maybe he’d had to create the collateral himself (he’s not a designer). So I bought the book, hoping there was more substance than there was style.</p>

<p>I’m sad to report that book is an utter waste of space and attention. More than money, I want my time back.</p>

<p>I’ve come to realize that while I love style, I don’t value style unless it’s backed by substance. And so I find myself conflicted. I’m torn between judging the merits of another’s work and

        <p>I’ve come to believe all creative work is a constant struggle between hope and fear. Hope that what I’m making will add value to the world. Hope that it will be accepted by the market. Hope that it will be interesting or resonate in a meaningful way. Fear that it won’t. Fear that everyone will laugh at me. Fear that people will call me names and think I’m an idiot for having made something so laughably dumb.</p> <p>There’s a lot of fear. Especially when I let the noise in or get sucked into the trap of comparing myself to others.</p> <p>But none of these fears outshines the biggest fear I have. Top billing is reserved for a fear that whispers to me in my quiet moments, the moments when I’m otherwise unencumbered and have some space to think: my fear of getting too comfortable. My fear that I’ll stop growing, which is the day a creative starts dying. The mere suggestion of such a stall scares me. But I remain hopeful.</p> <h2 id="hope---fear--momentum">Hope - Fear = Momentum</h2> <p>I’ve come to realize that the moment-to-moment balance between hope and fear is a leading indicator of my momentum on a project. In any creative work, shit happens: features turn out to be much more difficult or impossible to implement, characters don’t develop predictably, plots change, timelines shift. Each of these moments feels like a miniature crisis, threatening the very life of my project itself and calling into question my sanity and capabilities. Over the course of a project this can happen tens or hundreds of times—and the effects are cumulative. If measurable, the psychological sum of these moments would represent a score indicating where on the fear–hope continuum I’m currently operating. The closer I am to fear, the more frantically and urgently...
