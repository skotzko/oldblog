I'm often asked what I'm reading or watching, what books I recommend, etc. I enjoy those questionsâ€”I love sharing material that's made a real difference in my life with others.

In that spirit, here is a collection of essays, books, and other resources that have been massively valuable to me and which I find myself recommending most often. This list is deliberately industry agnostic and focuses on the larger areas of life, regardless of what field you happen to work in. This list was last updated on {{ page.last_updated }}.

Live long and prosper!
