Over the last three or four months, I've noticed my energy levels decreasing and it has freaked me out a little bit. It's not that I have felt bad; I've just felt less and less _good_. I also noticed that my drive at work and sex drive were lower than they had been in the past, and having just turned 27 last week, that shouldn't be the case.

**WTF?**

Early this year, I developed [plantar fasciitis (PF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_fasciitis) in my left foot—if you're not familiar with it, PF is when the connective tissue between your heel and the ball of your foot becomes inflamed. You do not want this. I got it in January and spent a few months rehabbing my foot, only to have it come roaring back once I started training seriously again. (Aside: I've since figured out the root cause of the PF and will share the fix soon.) My hunch is that my decreased levels of exercise over the last few months are the cause of the energetic changes I'd been experiencing.

Clueless, I started digging. My research led me to looking at biomarkers and hormone levels in my body. I became very concerned when I discovered that my testosterone levels had dropped almost 30% in the last four months. Hooked, I started looking at cortisol, insulin, and other blood markers, searching for clues.

In my research, I came across the book ["Engineering the Alpha (ETA),"](http://www.amazon.com/Man-2-0-Engineering-Alpha-Muscle/dp/006222087X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1372145538&sr=8-1&keywords=engineering+the+alpha) which, despite its title, is actually backed by solid science. The gist of the ETA approach is this: Hormones run your body and control how you feel, so if you can manipulate your hormones through diet and exercise, it is logical that you can trigger sweeping changes in the body.

Now, I've always been a little obsessed with optimization, particularly self-optimization, so this is in my sweet spot. I really can't help it–I'm constantly asking questions, thinking, and tweaking my approach to the world. I'm always looking for a better way to solve problems, and exploring new methods of [achieving my goals](/2013/03/31/a-roadmap/).

And so&hellip;

## Announcing Experiment 1: a Manly Makeover
No, I'm not having those guys from 'Queer Eye For The Straight Guy' come into my house and swap out all my furniture and clothing. One, I like what I've got. Two, I think that show is long dead. Sorry Mom, I know you liked it. Third, I have a different kind of makeover in mind.

<!-- more -->

What I am doing is undertaking the ETA program full-on, to the letter, and seeing what happens. I'm tracking as much of the inputs and outputs as I can. I baselined my biomarkers, I'm logging all food and workouts, and will continue to keep it updated.

Going forward, I'm going to make my experiments public, as part of the ongoing process of exploring and sharing what I learn. That's right, I'm gonna play with myself in public. My hope is to (a) learn something and (b) share what I learn in a useful way. I welcome your feedback, suggestions, and criticism of these experiments. We're going open-book here.

Three components are at the heart of this exploration:

  1. A sense of adventure and curiosity. After all, this shit is supposed to be fun, right?
  2. Experimentation: breakthroughs often come from structured experiments, and experiments need&hellip;
  3. Data. In these experiments, I'll capture, share, and explore my data in relation to other data that I can track down.

Experiment 1 announced: today, June 25th. Experiment 1 began: one week ago, June 18th.

### Objective
My goal is to improve the following biomarkers:

  * **Testosterone**: I am concerned because my testosterone levels dropped almost 30% in the last four months, with no clear reason. Thankfully they were very high before so I'm still in a good range after the drop, but I'd like to get these back up.
  * **Cortisol**: I need to lower my stress levels. They are above the normal range and cortisol wreaks havoc on energy levels, drive, sex drive, and fat-burning ability. No bueno.
  * **Body fat**: I've been hovering around the 19% body fat level, which isn't terrible, but I could certainly be in better shape. I'm not in bad shape, but I'm not ripped either.
  * **Energy levels**: this is the hardest one to nail down because it is both subjective and partly psychological. But I'd like to have more energy throughout the day rather than having a primary burst of energy in the morning and then dragging ass for the rest of the day.

My kickoff observation is that I am excited about the promise this holds, intimidated by how to track it all, and also realize that in a sense this is bad science: there are a lot of variables at play here. If anything, this is an experiment in the realities of self-tracking, a core area of [the quantified self](http://quantifiedself.com/) that captivates me.

### The Rules of Engagement
I am to follow the ETA program of diet and exercise as closely as possible. There are four phases, each 1 month long, with very specific diet and exercise protocols. I'll go into more detail in the experiment log but know that it begins with a short, very low-carb phase (an "insulin reset") and circuit training in the gym.

### Tools
Even for someone who is deeply interested in self-tracking, this one is a little intimidating. There is a lot of data to be captured, tracked, and collated.

To start, I'll be aggregating data in a Google spreadsheet, logging my food with [Lose It](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lose-it!/id297368629?mt=8), and checking into daily activities with [Lift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lift/id530911645?mt=8). I may use [Moves](http://www.moves-app.com/), an app that passively tracks steps and has proven itself as accurate as a FitBit in that regard. I baselined my blood biomarkers in a Labcorp test via [Accesa Labs](https://www.accesalabs.com/), but I'm excited about the possibility of cheaper testing tools such as [Talking20](http://talking20.com).

And, as always, I'll be using my beloved [Evernote](http://evernote.com) and [Captio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/captio-email-yourself-1-tap/id370899391?mt=8) for notetaking. Jotter looks like a decent equivalent for all you Android people.

### Expectations & Hypothesis
It's not an experiment if you can't be wrong. So, a falsifiable hypothesis: I project that my bodyfat will decrease by at least 5%, my stress levels will come back into the normal range, and my testosterone will increase by at least 20%.

### Observations
I will be updating this [daily observation log](/experiments/experiment-log-1-a-manly-makeover). Check back for more details and [hit me up on Twitter](http://twitter.com/askotzko) if you're wondering about something.

### Conclusions
Stay tuned.
