I can't deny it anymore. Not after yesterday.

Yesterday I took an inventory of all the “stuff” I have in my life. Nothing was spared. This was a biblical accounting, King Herod style. I even counted the toothbrushes. There were six. Maybe I wanted spares for the next fifteen months? I don't know.

The Stuff in my life is drag. I thought we were friends. But Stuff, he pulls against me, actively resisting the direction I'm running. What a jerk. I probably won't grasp just how big the resistance is until it's gone.

Meet Stuff. He's kind of a jerk.

Stuff just kept growing, because he's amorphous, never in one place, so I didn't see how big he's gotten. He's spread around rooms, tucked into drawers, hidden under the bed. Sneaky, sneaky Stuff.

**Stuff got big**: he weighs about 2,616 pounds right now. He's got 2,932 body parts. He's cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of $37,000.

Before I started, I'd guessed 1,000 items. Lowballed that one.

([You can see the full inventory here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApBq5nqLSn9MdDZwdlpua0tkdERHeDYzWDZOMlhEU2c) I logged not just the count of stuff, but the weight and dollar value. I wanted to really understand the scope of this. A little OCD, but it worked for me.)

I've living under the accumulated weight of three thousand items, most of which I neither use nor even like anymore. No wonder I felt burdened.

<!-- more -->

**A smattering of my stuff:**

  * _Books_: I have 241 physical books which weigh 350–400 pounds in total. [All I really want from them is the notes I took when I was reading them. I'll be continuing to digitize those.](http://blog.andrewskotzko.com/learning) This is a huge waste of space. And HEAVY. I will only keep a short list of books that I truly care about having a physical copy of. Otherwise: Kindle.
  * _CDs_: seriously, 154 CDs? Literally “so ten years ago.”
  * _Clothes_: I have WAY too many clothes and wear a tiny percentage of them. If I haven't worn it in three months, bye bye. Turns out laundry day is an easy way to figure out what I actually use—just look at what I didn't have to wash.
  * _DVDs_: I don't have a TV or DVD player, and want neither. I live in the world of digital and online video. Digitize them and say goodbye.
  * _Assorted desk stuff from college_ (3 hole punch, etc): I'm not in college, don't have a trapper keeper, and haven't used any of this stuff in years.
  * _Mementos_: this is the hardest category of all. I'm legitimately not sure what to do with these, because they represent happy memories.

I mentioned how shocked I was at the results of my inventory to [Alex](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApBq5nqLSn9MdDZwdlpua0tkdERHeDYzWDZOMlhEU2c). He guessed it was pretty common. He's probably right. But what gets me isn't the sheer amount or cost of the items—although putting numbers on that did shock me—no, what gets me is the percentage of my stuff that I don't give a shit about. I don't know the exact percent, but [I'll go with Pareto and guesstimate 80%.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

Some parts of Stuff have been with me the whole way, dragged through nine moves starting with the move to California. Some parts of my Stuff aren't stuff, but actually Things that I value. (Congrats green, insanely comfortable Old Navy tee shirt: I love you.) Other parts are just Stuff: burdens that don't matter to me anymore and aren't actually in my life for any purpose. Example: my two guitars and keyboard. I've lugged those things around for six years. SIX YEARS. And I've barely played them at all in that time. Sure, I will get back into music again, but it's just not a priority for me right now and is unlikely to be for some time.

We all want more, right?

In our society, it's always about more more more. I want less.

I like certain types of more: More happiness. More success. More money. More love. etc etc. But more stuff? No thanks. Stuff sucks. Stuff is a parasite, a leech on me. I want to de-leech.

<img class="center img-center" imgsrc="/images/stuffleech.jpg" alt="">

Stuff is with me all the time, leeching my energy and focus from the activities and moments that really matter. What a jerk. I'm un-friending him and un-hoarding. I'm opening up space for new, good things in my life by clearing out the old and stagnant.

In short, [I don't want any more stuff, I'm only interested in things](http://www.raptitude.com/2011/01/i-dont-want-stuff-any-more-only-things/). What's the difference? Things have meaning and value. Stuff has only the space and energy it drains.
