why I’m rebooting my personal blog. My mission is to help people know themselves as powerful and capable of making a real difference in their world. And technology is how I want to do that. Fundamentally, I want people to see themselves as capable of affecting the world around them powerfully and knowing how to use technology to do it.
To that end, most of my writing is going to be focused in that direction, and is going to be focused on teaching technology, how to think about it, and how to wield it powerfully. So, fair warning: expect much more technical content coming.

To give you an idea of what I mean, here are sneak peeks at the next two posts that will be coming.

First on the list is an exploration of how messages flow across the Internet between computers at a low level. I’m going to write about this because understanding it gives you powerful knowledge as a developer to create distributed systems. As I shared before, one of my goals is to make distributed computing accessible for all developers. Hence my work on the Akka project. Well, it’s tough to deal powerfully with distributed systems if you don’t understand at least the basics of how messages flow across the network.

Second on the list is an exploration of what makes an open-source software (OSS) project successful. Akka .NET is growing rapidly in adoption, production usage, and in contributors—all great signs. But how is that happening? How did we get here, and how are we charting a course to where we’re going? OSS is one of the most powerful forces to emerge in technology over the last fifteen years, and I want us to explore how it works and give you a view inside such a project. That’s a viewpoint most people (even developers) never see.
