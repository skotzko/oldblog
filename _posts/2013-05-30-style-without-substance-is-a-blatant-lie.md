I hate seeing good people buy bad things. It's not my business what someone buys with their money or attention, but I do care about the work that a creator/marketer presents to a paying public. To use a food analogy, I feel especially angry when the presentation is all sizzle and no steak; when a piece of low-quality beef that was hurriedly and unlovingly prepared is being billed as a bone-in ribeye that's been painstakingly marinated, seared, and slow-cooked into a medium-rare oblivion of bliss.





Quality matters. But so does presentation. Substance without style is never even looked at. But style without substance is a blatant lie.





Here's what got me thinking...





## Is it fair to judge a book by its cover?





An acquaintance of mine from years ago recently published a book. I saw a very excited post on Facebook about it, overwhelmed with emotion about the book "hitting the bestseller list." I was curious and excited because I like this person and wanted to see what he had made, so I clicked through to check it out. Immediately, my bullshit meter started pinging based on the design of the website and book. But I wanted to give it a chance. After all, he was self-publishing this book, and maybe he'd had to create the collateral himself (he's not a designer). So I bought the book, hoping there was more substance than there was style.





I'm sad to report that book is an utter waste of space and attention. More than money, I want my time back.





I've come to realize that while I love style, I don't value style unless it's backed by substance. And so I find myself conflicted. I'm torn between judging the merits of another's work and<!-- more -->celebrating the fact that this person actually made and shipped something.





## Am I just being jealous?





I've considered writing a book before, so at first I did feel a twinge of jealousy at his having checked a box that I have not. I think everyone feels this at one point or another: why not me? Why haven't I done that? Hey, I had that idea first!





Sometimes, it just feels like a zero-sum game. But creativity, by definition, is not zero-sum: there is always more to create!





I have more questions than answers: Do I even have the right to judge the work of another? Am I just creatively jealous? Is bad work even worth any attention, or should I just ignore it? How much do good intentions matter compared to the quality of the final product? Is it inevitable to compare oneself to others?





I haven't thought through all these questions. But a thought occurs to me: **The choice between judging a work and supporting the creator of that work is a false dichotomy.** I don't have to judge the work OR support that the work was shipped, I can do both. It helps to judge the quality of the execution and the quality of the content/idea separately, which puts me into a mindset of constructive, but still supportive, criticism.





One thing is certain: focusing on what someone else has made that I haven't does nothing to advance my work. I try to acknowledge the reality and support the accomplishment, but stay grounded and keep playing my own game. While the negative motivation of jealousy (or anger, fear, etc) can be effective in the short term, this negative fuel is not a healthy or sustainable source of energy. In the longer term, it feels so much better, and is so much more beneficial, to put all that energy into yourself. It feels good just thinking about not wasting that energy.





There is lots of marginal work out there. Most work, by definition, is marginal, and adds nothing of real value to the world. That said, I will continue to side with the creators of the world and congratulate them on shipping their ideas. And to remind them, and myself, to make sure the next work shipped is at least marginally better. It is only through marginal work that creators end up achieving spectacular work.





As long as you never lie to your audience, I say ship, ship, and ship some more.
