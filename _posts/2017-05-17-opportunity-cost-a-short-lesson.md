# Opportunity cost a short lesson
Mathematical calculation of it-eg if option A has potential opportunity
cost (POC) of 60 and option B has POC of 40, my total potential opportunity
cost (TPOC) is 100.

Now, either choice has opportunity cost. That is the nature of all
decisions. Either choice also has upside.

If I go down path A, let's say it works pretty well. I learn some useful
things, meet some good people, but in the end discover it wasn't the
vehicle for me.

The only thing that doesn't work is not choosing. Not moving forward at
all. When that happens, I pay the FULL opportunity cost. This took me
awhile to realize. I had been spending time analyzing my choices, my
options.

What is it
I pay it the most when I resist it

This is usually grounded in fear of commitment, and underneath that is fear
of failure. Underneath that is fear of the ego.

## No right choices, just good choosing
Picked this up from DYL book. There are no right choices, just good
choosing. What's that mean?

It means that the process I use to make a choice is going to have a major
impact on how I feel about that choice once I've made it. Heard of buyer's
remorse? That's just one example of this.

SCRATCH BELOW

My default is overthinking. I've overthought everything, feared opportunity
cost / been dominated by it.

I'm scared by opportunity cost. But opportunity cost is a given all the
time with any path. Opportunity cost is a fact of life. Any way I go there
will always be the risk that it's a "waste of time" or doesn't work out.

As a generalist focus more on the problem that I really want to solve than
on my specific role or function

When I resist opportunity cost, I pay the full cost. It's less (and
inevitable) once I choose.

Fear is about wasting effort (opportunity cost)
