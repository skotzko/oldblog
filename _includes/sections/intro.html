      <h3 class="greeting text-center">Hello, world! I'm Andrew.</h3>

      <h4 class="text-center">I try to create new technology to impact the world's biggest problems.</h4>

      <p>I do that by working at the intersection of technology, business, and social impact. I try to work out what's going on, what will happen next, and where the gap is.</p>

      <p>I'm always reaching beyond what I know, investing in what can be, and finding the silver-lining.</p>

          <li>I believe we're either learning and growing, or dying.</li>
