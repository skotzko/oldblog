      <h3 class="greeting text-center">Hello, world! I'm Andrew.</h3>

      <h4 class="text-center">I try to create new technology to impact the world's biggest problems.</h4>

      <p>I work at the intersection of technology, business, and social impact. I try to work out what's going on, what will happen next, and where the gap is. I also write about thisâ€”see the <a href="#blog">blog</a> section below.</p>

      <p>I'm innovative, insatiably curious, and intensely interested in discovering what's possible.</p>
