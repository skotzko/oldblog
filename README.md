### Commands
Run grunt to compile css from sass: `grunt` in terminal. It will launch watch. `control-c` to stop.

May have to run a `bower install` also.

You need to have grunt installed. <a href="http://daigo.org/2013/11/installing-npm-on-mavericks-macbook-pro/">This blog post</a> may be useful if you are like me and running Mac OS X.

To run jekyll locally, run `jekyll serve`

If you want to make sure foundation is up to date, try

`foundation update`

(requires bower)
