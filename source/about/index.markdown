I always keep asking questions, and share what I learn.

I want to be as creative as possible and always keep learning and growing.

## Me in 10 seconds:
  * I'm a curious entrepreneur and believe we're either learning and growing, or dying
  * I'm passionate about using technology to help people connect, express their humanity, and unlock their own capabilities
  * I'm obsessed with learning and growing
  * My favorite parable: ["Eat Me If You Wish"](http://www.andrewskotzko.com/eat-me-if-you-wish/)
