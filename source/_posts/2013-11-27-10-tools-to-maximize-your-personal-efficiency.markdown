Frank Addante, CEO of Rubicon Project, came up with this list of his favorite productivity tools. Good read! Here are my favorite two from his list:







  1. SaneBox: Smart Email Filtering Tool SaneBox uses advanced algorithms to organize your email into low and high priority buckets. It works with any email client, email service or device. I was kinda hesitant about handing over control of my inbox, but now I'm not sure how I functioned without it. SaneBox has saved me hours of my life and works damn well. Check your @SaneLater folder (low priority email) twice a day and mail from senders you don’t want to hear from again to @SaneBlackHole.

  2. Evernote (Organizes your notes): Evernote stores your notes in the cloud and makes them accessible from any computer or device. Tips: Evernote is for business and personal use. I use it to take all of my meeting notes and jot down general personal items and ideas. I also use Evernote to scan/fax important documents that I need to keep on hand. Evernote is also helpful for keeping track of project notes and critical documents such as driver’s license, passport, insurance documents, etc., especially when I travel and want digital copies.
