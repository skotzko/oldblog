After the forum, had to confront the fact that I've been afraid to share my biggest ambitions or that I'm a creator. I had somehow got the idea in my head that I couldn't make big things happen, or that I was undeserving of creating massively transformational work.

What a load of crap.

I never really admitted that I want to change the world. Sure, everyone knew that I was driven, but actually change the world... what? Are you crazy? Is what I was afraid they would say to me.

The world is suffering from a crisis of imagination.

I want to build the tools that are needed to solve abundance. Clean water, renewable energy. Save the planet with computing.

Critical abundance challenges:

- food
- water
- energy
- healthcare

Cool sources of inspiration:
- IBM
- Socrata
- open data movement
- code for america
- singularity U
-

Abundant computing.

What if we used the world's computing resources and computer talents for good? What if we used them to invent new possibilities to humanities most important problems?


subject: hey Petri, let’s do a thought experiment... what could be possible for you w/ akka.net?

Hey Petri,

First of all, thank you for participating in Akka.NET Bootcamp. We’re grateful for your dedication to your craft and love to help developers like you.

One of the things that we never stopped to do was to explain where all this came from. Why do we think learning Akka.NET is important? Why are we building Petabridge, Akka.NET, and Helios? I’ll tell you MY reason…

Growing up, my family moved all over the world due to my parents jobs. We lived in and traveled to some very exotic, and often poor, countries. As a kid, I was evacuated from two different countries (Chad, and Indonesia) due to political instability, civil unrest, and conflict.

I saw early on that there were real difficulties in the world, and that I had an obligation to help. Fast forward to right after college, and by then I’d become fascinated with how technology could scalably solve problems in the world.

I fell in love with programming and quit my (awesome) job in marketing. Programming was a totally transformative experience for me. Why? It was the first time in my life that I experienced that I could make things, and that what I made could make a difference for people. I’d never experienced that before.

Today, when I look around the world I see amazing possibilities. I believe that we can create a world of abundance within my lifetime. And I also believe that to create that world of abundance, we’re going to need massive technological breakthroughs in fields as diverse as energy production, farming, clean water, healthcare, and education.

What do these diverse fields all have in common? Computers. As Andreesen famously said, “software is eating the world.” Computing is now a critical component of every major industry and field. And the software of our future will not be written like the software of our past.

The software of our future will be distributed. It will be infinitely scalable. It will be realtime, and react to data streams as needed to take the right actions, at the right time, in the right place. And enabling THAT future is the reason why I think Akka.NET is important, and why I’m working on Akka.NET.

Let me ask you: What could happen to YOUR business or nonprofit if you embraced this kind of software? What kind of new capabilities could you have? What competitors or new markets could you take on and compete with?


technology is a resource liberator, an enabler of and force multiplier for possibility

Growing up, my family moved all over the world due to my parents jobs. We lived in and traveled to some very exotic, and often poor, countries. As a kid, I was evacuated from two different countries (Chad, and Indonesia) due to political instability, civil unrest, and conflict.

I saw early on that there were real difficulties in the world, and that I had an obligation to help. But I also became captivated with the potential that people had when they had access to basic resources, and how people from all walks of life could connect with each other when conflict didn’t get in the way.

Fast forward to just after college, and by then I’d become fascinated with how technology could scalably solve problems and be a force for improvement in the world.

Soon after, I fell in love with programming and quit my job in marketing. Programming was a totally transformative experience for me. Why? It was the first time in my life that I experienced that I could make things, and that what I made could make a difference for people. I’d never experienced that before.

Today, when I look at the world I see a world of possibility. I believe that we can create a world of abundance within my lifetime. But to create that world of abundance, we’re going to need massive technological breakthroughs in fields as diverse as energy production, farming, clean water, healthcare, and education.

What do these diverse fields all have in common?

Computers.

As Andreesen famously said, “software is eating the world.” Computing is now a critical component of every major industry and field.

To achieve the breakthroughs we need, it’s going to take massive computing power paired up with the best advancements in these fields themselves. What can happen to farming,

What could happen to your business if you embraced distributed computing systems? What kinds of a business could you build? What competitors or new markets could you take on and compete with?



# i believe that a world of abundance is within our grasp, and that distributed computing is essential to that

# learning akka and helios (two key tools in this ecosystem) are essential first steps to build the kinds of distributed systems we’ll need
These new tools are a force multiplier for that drive to create things.

Solving the major problems of the future will require different software to enable new solutions that we haven’t even imagined yet.




Aaron and I, the founders of Petabridge, believe that the future is something we’re all creating right now. And that in order to create a future where bold challenges can be overcome, we have to look past what we already know and discover new ways of doing things.


We’re here to help you discover entirely new ways to take on such audacious challenges. THAT is why this matters to us.


I grew up bouncing all over the world, and got a deep seated desire to do something meaningful to help people.

Growing up, my family moved between the US and several countries quite a few times due to my parents work. We lived in and traveled to some very poor countries where people suffered greatly. As a kid, I was evacuated from two different countries (Chad, and Indonesia) due to political instability, civil unrest, and conflict.


From my earliest memories onward, I saw how harsh the world could be for people.

And yet I also saw beauty. I saw grace, compassion, and the incredible wonders of the world. I traveled to 53 countries and all 7 continents. I saw how people from all walks of life could be connect with each other in joy, mutual understanding, and the shared experience of being human.

Later, after college, I quit my job in marketing and fell in love with programming because it was the first time I’d experienced in my life that I could create things that made a real difference. It was the first time I’d experienced that viscerally.

These new tools are a force multiplier for that drive to create things.

Solving the major problems of the future will require different software to enable new solutions that we haven’t even imagined yet.

Distributed and infinite computing

Solving the great challenges of the future starts with making the small change of simply learning how to write software a little differently.
