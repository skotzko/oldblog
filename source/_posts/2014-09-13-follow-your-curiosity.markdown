TITLE IDEAS:

Walking through the desert

Follow your curiosity

_This is the first post in an ongoing, "good advice" series, where I pay forward the advice I've received which has made or is making a real difference for me._

A little while ago, I was feeling pretty damn frustrated. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was drifting for awhile and exploring different landscapes and scenes of the tech world.

For several months, since I got back from South America (tk link to SA post) I had been looking at different areas to start building some prototypes in. Looking at mobile, big data, etc. And trying to come up with ideas.

And I worked on that for awhile. From May or June until July, I tried out quite a few ideas. All of them either didn't work, or I didn't like them enough to pursue. I mean, if I couldn't get myself interested in working on something for two or three weeks, how could I possibly build it into something real and interesting for other people? Nonstarter.

So this all got pretty frustrating and I got frustrated by the lack of progress and wanting to have a real direction to run in. So I started asking other entrepreneurs, "what do you do in this situation?" And I got a lot of answers back. And apart from a few nuggets, most of those answers weren't very useful. So then I got frustrated with that.

But then, I just happened to be up in SF with 500 (tk 500 link) and happened to grab lunch with Mat Johnson (tk link) a really nice and smart guy who works on distribution with portfolio companies. In terms of startups, he's been around the block a few times. So I asked him the same question I'd been asking everyone else: "

Things were kind of frustrating because I didn't really know where I wanted to go. I was experimenting with ideas, trying out prototypes, and nothing was working. So I started asking people for their advice: 

> How do you walk through the desert and make it out alive?

This was my mental walk through the desert.

I got many responses, some useful, many not. But eventually, I happened to have lunch with Mat Johnson (tk twitter link) and asked him the same. His response? "Yeah, that's not going to work. You're forcing it."

Okay. So, what would? His advice:

> I wish I could give you a formula for this, but as far as I know there isn't one. 
> 
> The only approach I think has a decent chance of working is just to follow your curiosity and see where it leads you.

As soon as I heard that, I knew he was right. But even so, what to do didn't really hit me for awhile. 

I started reflecting on all the different things I'd looked at in the last six months. And what I quickly realized was that all the things that I'd actually thought were interesting, and neat or cool—as opposed to what I thought I should be interested in—all of these things did in fact have something in common.

And that something was the fact that **they all involved turning data into information.**

They were things like:

* automatically detecting and preventing ecommerce fraud by using machine learning
* making weather satellites adapt their scanning based on realtime feeds from ground sensors
* predicting which uber expensive piece of manufacturing equipment most likely to fail next

These are a bit prosaic on the surface, but actually fascinating (to me) when I dug into how it works. I'm hooked—this big data stuff is fascinating. 

The ridiculous quantities of data we are generating every day are beyond anything we've ever encountered in human history. And I believe in that data. I believe in the latent power in that data to make the world a better place and to give people delight and value and help in ways that we can't even imagine yet.

And so what I realized is that this answer—big data—has been sitting right in front of me all along. So, long story short, following my curiosity made me realize that big data was the area I was interested in and narrowed a world of possibility into a concrete direction that I can walk in. And that is the basis for all my projects going forward, some of which I hope to go public with very soon.

But enough about me. Follow your curiosity—where will it take you?
