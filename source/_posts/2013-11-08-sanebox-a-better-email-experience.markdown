![Inbox](http://andrewblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/inbox-300x132.png)





A while back, I decided to get rid of the clutter in my apartment. Little by little, I worked my way through each room, figuring out what was essential for everyday, mementos that reminded me of happy days, and then there was the other category: everything else. After I sold off most of the third category, I sat down to answer a quick work email. It struck me as humorous that after spending an entire day cleaning my house, I was bombarded with a full inbox. If I was going to embark on this decluttering adventure, I had to go all-in. My inbox needed a change.





I searched around for a solution, and saw that others were like me in my quest for inbox zero. I tried [SaneBox](http://www.sanebox.com), and it’s everything it implies, bringing a little sanity to my email. It uses an algorithm to figure out which emails are important based on how I’ve interacted with a someone in the past. All of the mail that’s from less important senders is put into a folder named SaneLater. A couple times a week, I give that folder a quick scan to make sure everything’s in the right place, which it almost always is.





It has a bunch of other cool features, but my favorite is SaneBlackhole: drag an email into it, and never see another email from that sender again. One other thing I discovered is that because it works on the mail servers, Sanebox doesn’t just filter mail on my computer —it filters mail before it gets to my phone and iPad also. Anyway, if your inbox is driving you nuts, I’d definitely recommend checking out [SaneBox](http://www.sanebox.com).
