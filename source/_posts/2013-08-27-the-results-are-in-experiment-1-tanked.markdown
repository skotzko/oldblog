Nobody likes to start something with a failure.





Especially a public something.





I just did that.





## What happened?





A few months ago, I announced that I was going to begin publishing my ongoing experiments. In [experiment 1](http://www.andrewskotzko.com/2013/06/25/announcing-personal-experiments/), I hoped to make some physical changes and feel better, have more energy, etc. The plan was to workout and quantify my progress both inside and outside my body.





It was a good idea, a good intention, and decently planned out. But it was too much, too soon.





I was trying to do everything all at once. I was working out intensely, at least 4 days a week. I was tracking everything I ate down to the calorie and macronutrient profile. I was tracking my steps, commute times, blood markers, mood, hours of sleep, and basically everything else I could think of. My OCD-tendencies blossomed into fullness on this one, to my partial regret. I don't regret the things I started to track, or the intentions I came up with: I was truly seeking useful data. But I do regret the way I did it: all at once. The other mistake I made was to make it a BIG thing (to my mind) that was fairly long term (4 months).





I'm declaring Experiment 1 a failure because I was not able to finish the experiment and fell off the wagon.





## What I learned





Here is a link to the [spreadsheet where I was tracking everything](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApBq5nqLSn9MdDBIdFdrZGZzQUY0UzFBUVh5emtSOWc&usp=sharing).





Looking over those documents, a few things are clear: I was more consistent at doing the workouts than I was at tracking it all. In fact, I found the tracking aspect exhausting due to how manual everything was. I kept doing the workouts and diet for over a month but quit all the tracking after about 2 full weeks. Automation of data collection and aggregation is going to be essential for future efforts in this space.





I was surprised by how much I liked doing an ongoing log of thoughts in the observations. It was a good way to vent, and in retrospect, lets me see the arc of the experiment. [Let me know](http://www.andrewskotzko.com/about/) one thing that stands out to you.





I do take away a few lessons from the experiment that are useful:



<!-- more -->





  * I am strongly reminded to start new projects small and let them progress incrementally, rather than trying to force a new effort to be fully matured immediately.


  * I was interested in using the project as a hands-on way to learn more about the practical applications and challenges of the [Quantified Self (QS) movement](http://quantifiedself.com/). The punchline: there is massive value to be derived from collecting and implementing personal analytics, but it won't take off until it is much easier than it is today. Automation is critical and probably a necessary component to realize the promise of QS.


  * Everyone wants to be more awesome. Although QS and self-experimentation can involve private areas of our lives, people are fundamentally interested in exploring this field and using it to improve their lives. I had more in-person conversations about this experiment than almost any of my previous ones (which were not written up publicly).


  * I must be wary of my OCD tendencies around data and research, and never allow augmentation / secondary efforts (e.g. extensive logging) to overwhelm the real work (working out consistently).


  * I now think that the key to making any big change is to make incremental small changes, such that the "new thing" isn't some new external thing at all, but gradually just becomes part of who I am. After all, it's easy and natural to do things that are "just who we are" without needing extra motivation. The trick is to hack that process with small changes that become habits and add up.





At some point in the future, I'll re-approach this experiment in a more incremental fashion rather than trying to boil the ocean. That will also have the added benefit of isolating the variables which is a better approach to data-driven experimentation anyway.





Onward.
